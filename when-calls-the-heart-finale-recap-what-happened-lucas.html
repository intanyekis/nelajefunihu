<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>When Calls The Heart Finale Recap: What Happened to Lucas?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It’s been three weeks since Lucas chugged off into the night after being dumped by Elizabeth. Rosemary and Elizabeth kick things off by making plans for the election, which is set to take place the next day. They also discuss Goldie’s upcoming baptism, with Rosemary saying Lee and Joseph taking care of all the arrangements. (Anybody else think that could turn into a disaster?)</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lee-and-Rosemary-WCTH.jpg alt="Lee and Rosemary, When Calls the Heart" width=1024 height=599 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Facing her usually bright-eyed pupils, Elizabeth prepares to teach them about Election Day. But she quickly notices that they’re all unusually quiet. When she asks why, Opal responds that everyone’s supposed to vote for Lucas so he can save the town. “But what if we don’t like Mr. Bouchard?” she asks. Turns out, the kids feel bad because of Elizabeth’s cancelled wedding.&nbsp;In true Elizabeth fashion, she explains that sometimes people are better off as friends… but doesn’t actually come clean with the tots by admitting she called things off, not Lucas.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rosemary breaks out the gown she was baptized in, which will also be used for Goldie’s ceremony. While discussing details about the baptism, Lee reminds his wife that they still need to pick a godfather. “Whoever it is needs to be just as special as [Goldie],” says Rosemary, prompting Lee to admit he has an idea. “But I think you’re going to need to sit down for this one!” Once she does, he suggests Henry would be a great godfather. “He’s probably the last person to admit this, but he’s pretty good with kids,” points out Lee.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/When-Calls-the-Heart-Henry.jpg alt="When Calls the Heart - Henry" width=1024 height=599 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I’ll be the first to acknowledge that Henry has had his troubles,” he continues, “but he is the wiser because of them.” Agreeing wisdom is important in a godfather, Rosemary eventually agrees — despite how very cantankerous Henry can be! “Maybe he needs Goldie just as much as she needs him,” muses Rosemary.</p><p>At the stables, Bill and Nathan catch up. When Nathan says he’s heading out to check on some Pinkertons who are probably Montague hires, Bill saddles up to go along in case there’s trouble. Nathan manages to convince the Pinkertons to leave, given there’s no point in guarding an irrigation site that isn’t actually being used.</p><p>All of Hope Valley seems to be rallying around Lucas, determined to Bust the Ballot Box For Bouchard (or BTBBFB which, as Rosemary and Elizabeth point out, is a whole lotta B’s. Although I’d have thrown on a final “B” for “Brigade.”) It’s a tad awkward, given that it was also supposed to be Elizabeth’s wedding day. But Elizabeth tells Rosemary she’s happy and even at peace with her decision. “Maybe that’s what engagements are for,” suggests her friend. Talk soon turns to Nathan, with Elizabeth sharing that her ex had asked if she was happy with her decision.</p><p>Lee approaches Henry about the whole godfather thing, and the older man is clearly taken aback. “I don’t know much about God, and I think if you spoke to my son, he’d tell you I know even less about being a father,” reflects Henry. Lee convinces Henry to at least think about it, pointing out that he and Rosemary wouldn’t have asked if they didn’t think he was the right man for the job. Later, Joseph suggests being Goldie’s godfather could be good for Henry.</p><p>Despite life keeping both of them pretty busy, when Mei says she’s heading to the hot springs to get clay, Mike offers to go along and help. “It’s a date,” he says, and that choice of words clearly tickles them both. (Adorably, Mike even does a little dance as Mei walks away.)</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WCTH-Mei-Mike-date-.png alt="WCTH Mei Mike Date " width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Elizabeth and Lucas catch up over the phone, with her making it clear he has her support. “I think I needed to hear that,” he admits, adding that he knows he made the right decision. “As much as I wanted to stay, if I hadn’t gotten on that train, I would have regretted it.” Ned presents Rosemary with buttons which can be given to people who vote. It will give them a chance to thank people for doing their civic duty… or scolding them if they don’t. She’s not sure scolding is such a great idea, but loves the buttons.</p><p>Election Day turns into a bit of a mess with long lines stretching as far as the eye can see. Elizabeth comes up with the idea of making extra booths in which people can vote, after which she and Rosemary go out to recruit the two dozen people who have not yet voted. How do they find them? Looking for people without buttons!</p><p>Elizabeth talks to Henry about the sins of the past and the fact that he’s earned his redemption and forgiveness. He can’t help but think of Abigail, clearly missing her. And sure enough, by episode’s end, he has showed up on her doorstep!</p><p>Just before the polls are going to close, Nathan enters to cast his ballot. He and Elizabeth talk about their last conversation, the tensions running high between them. But before either can say how they truly feel, he exits.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WCTH-Elizabeth-Nathan-Vote-.png alt="When Calls The heart Nathan Elizabeth vote" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The next day at the saloon, words comes down that Lucas won the election by just 21 votes. And at the baptism, Henry shows up — better late than never — while Joseph speaks from the heart. As for Mike and Mei, although he wound up getting so busy at the saloon that he accidentally stood her up, Faith and Fiona help the would-be pair finally come together and admit they like each other.</p><p>In the final moments, Bill is shocked when Madeline walks into the saloon. “I know I&nbsp; can’t expect you to forgive me for what I did,” she says, “But I want you to know what Hope Valley has meant to Jamie and me. What you’ve meant.” And as Lucas leaves the campaign headquarters in Capital City, a car pulls up. We don’t see the driver, but Lucas ominously asks, “What are you doing here?”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WCTH-Lucas-who-.png alt="When Calls the Heart Lucas mystery person" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>And at Jack’s grave, Elizabeth talks to her late love.&nbsp; “When I lost you, something inside me just broke,” she whispers. “The thought of going through that again… I loved Lucas, but I think I was looking for something safe so I couldn’t get hurt again. Because what if… what if I broke a second time, but couldn’t put the pieces back together again? I couldn’t risk it, especially when I have little Jack to think of. But that wasn’t fair to Lucas. He deserves to have a great love. We both do.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WCTH-Elizabeth-Jacks-Grave.png alt="WCTH When Calls The heart Elizabeth at Jack's Grave" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Soon after, as Elizabeth sits quietly, Nathan rides up on his horse. And just when it seems they might finally speak their truths, Bill rides up. Why? “It’s Lucas,” he says urgently. “I need you both… now!” As the three ride back into town, the screen fades to black…</p><p><strong>Want to know who your favorite <a href=# rel=noopener>When Calls The Heart stars are dating</a> in real life?
