Stephen Jackson of the San Antonio Spurs was slapped with a $25,000 after posting threatening remarks to Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder during OKC’s Friday night game against the Los Angeles Lakers. During a quick altercation, Ibaka was tangled up with the Lakers’ Metta World Peace (Ron Artest), resulting in both players earning technical fouls. Jackson then took to Twitter to defend World Peace, his former Indiana Pacers teammate."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Next time he run up on me im goin in his mouth. That’s a promise. He doin 2 much,” he tweeted.</p><p>Once the announcement of his penalty was made by the NBA’s Executive Vice President <strong>Stu Jackson</strong>, the Spurs forward deleted the tweet, and posted an apology for his misconduct.</p><p>“I apologize to Serge Ibaka, the NBA, and to all my fans for the comments I made,” Jackson later tweeted. “It was unprofessional and childish. I’m not a thug just a man who speaks his mind. It was not appropriate. I do apologize. Only a man can admit when he’s wrong.</p><p>The Spurs organization is in full support of reprimanding Jackson. General Manager RC Buford released a statement in favor of the NBA’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_fine_3 data-tag=fine>fine</a>.</p><p>“The recent public comments made by Stephen Jackson are absolutely unacceptable, cannot be tolerated and do not reflect the standards held by the San Antonio Spurs,” the statement read.</p><p>Jackson and World Peace are no strangers to combat; the two were involved in the now infamous brawl Pacer-Pistons brawl known as “Malice at the Palace.” Both players suffered extensive suspensions, with World Peace missing the remainder of the 2004-05 season.</p><p>If Jackson has plans of going through with his threats, there may be a bit of drama when the Spurs take on OKC on Dec. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBprzHnqVmopGYuLS7zWaenqyjYn92t4yfoKedXanEqsDTnqlmrJinsqLAjGppbXFpbnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-precious-based-on-a-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>Is Precious Based on a True Story?</span></a>
