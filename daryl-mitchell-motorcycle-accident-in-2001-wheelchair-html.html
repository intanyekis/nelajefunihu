He pushed his way through to make the best out of a difficult situation — he had a serious motorcycle accident in 2001 that bounded him in a wheelchair.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite that, he has been striving for what matters to him the most — a distinguished acting career.</p><h2>He Was Riding Kawasaki Ninja 900</h2><p>In the early morning hours of November 10, 2001, Mitchell&nbsp;took&nbsp;his nephew's Kawasaki Ninja 900 out for a spin. Little did he know he would not come back the same. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2002 interview with People, the Wyandanch native <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relived</a>&nbsp;the terrifying accident. "I rode off, and I never came back," the iron-willed actor recalled. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Mitchell was on Warshaw Island on vacation with his family when the accident happened. He was by no means a rookie rider, as he had a Kawasaki Ninja 1100 in his home.&nbsp;</p><h2>Spinal Cord Injury Left Him Paralyzed for Life</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Further along in the interview with People, Mitchell <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled</a> the memory he had before the crash. He could remember getting out of his brother's Ford Explorer at a nightclub in Beaufort and getting his new gray boots dirty in the sand. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That was when he noticed his nephew Everette's bike. Everette had offered his motorcycle the day before to him, but he had politely declined because he had some drinks.&nbsp;However, on the night in question, Daryl was completely sober. So, he gave it a try.</p><p>The next thing in Mitchell's memory was waking up in the hospital in Charleston.</p><p>He had skidded off a gravel-strewn road on Warshaw Island near Beaufort, S.C., and suffered a fractured wrist, punctured lungs, bruised kidneys, and, worst of all, damage to his spinal cord. The injury on his spine left him paralyzed from the chest down. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Took Full Responsibility for the Accident</h2><p>Mitchell took full responsibility for the accident. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a>&nbsp;to People that he rode off with no protective gears on a road he didn't know.</p><p>It was totally my fault. I took off in the dark without a helmet on a road I didn’t know.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He had been taken to Beaufort Memorial Hospital, and the doctors there were not sure if he would survive the airlift to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. But Mitchell was a fighter — always had been.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The NCIS: New Orleans<strong>&nbsp;</strong>actor plowed through recovery one step at a time. It didn't matter how many bones in his body the <a href=# rel=follow>accident</a>&nbsp;broke; it was nowhere near enough to break his spirit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I’m going to keep doing what I do, which is striving for a great career.</p><p>Though he recovered from the wounds, he was paralyzed from the chest down. He had to work through therapy just to&nbsp;put on his sneakers.</p><p>Less than a year after the crash, he trained himself to get dressed, drive, shoot pool, and even take a few rounds off at the pistol range.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Oscars Venue Didn't Have Enough Wheelchair Seatings</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Although many names from the industry called and came to visit Daryl, one name stood out — Denzel Washington.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"He [Denzel] flew up from Miami to take me to the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis fight in his plane," the Inside Man star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>.</p><p>Denzel even invited Daryl to come to the Oscars that year, but unfortunately, the venue did not have enough wheelchair seatings. He returned from the event and promised he would make everyone know about wheelchairs.</p><h2>Daryl did not Let the Wheelchair Slow Him Down</h2><p>The accident occurred nineteen years ago, and sure enough, the <a href=# rel=follow>Hollywood</a>&nbsp;veteran lived up to his words. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After his accident, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">starred</a> in over a dozen TV shows, including Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Ed, Fear Of The Walking Dead, and NCIS: New Orleans.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>For obvious reasons, Michell — or as the industry affectionately calls him Daryl "Chill" — has done an outstanding job&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">portraying</a> his characters on wheelchairs. He has garnered a lot of love from everyone in the industry, fans, and colleagues alike for his tenacity.&nbsp;</p><p>He even won the Image Awards for his stints in Brothers in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>"When people see me, they say, 'Man, you're the only black actor on TV in a wheelchair.' But I'm not proud of that. That's unreal, to be the only," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>&nbsp;Mitchell&nbsp;as a member of the Representing Disability in Storytelling&nbsp;panel in April 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mus8XLZqSirJOdsq24jKamraeimMakuMRmmJybmZmyr8CMoqVmamBlfm7Dx56cpZuYlrazesetpKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caroline-vazzana-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-475365-html.html><span>←</span><span>Caroline Vazzana Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
