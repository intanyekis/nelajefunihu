<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>KellyOsbourneand Sid Wilsons Relationship Timeline</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A friends to lovers romance.&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kelly&nbsp;Osbourne</strong></a> met her boyfriend, <strong>Sid Wilson</strong>, two decades before they started dating — and it was all thanks to dad <a href=#><strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a>.</p><p>The U.K. native met Wilson in 1999 when his band Slipknot toured with Ozzfest — the music festival founded by the “Shut Up” <a href=#>singer’s parents</a>. The pair developed a friendship that lasted for over two decades before officially confirming&nbsp;in February 2022 that&nbsp;their relationship had turned romantic.</p><p>“After 23 years of friendship I can’t believe where we have ended up!” the Dancing With the Stars alum wrote in a February 2022 Instagram post. “You are my best friend, my soulmate and I am so deeply in love with you&nbsp;Sidney George Wilson.”</p><p>Wilson, for his part, made his own post about the <a href=#>Emmy Award winner</a>.</p><p>“There [are] not enough colors to display the palette of Love I have for you in my Heart. Happy Valentines Day my Love XoXo,” the Iowa native wrote to his girlfriend the same day.</p><p>In May 2022,&nbsp;Osbourne&nbsp;announced she is <a href=#>expecting her first child</a>.</p><p>“I know that I have been very quiet these past few months so I thought I would share with you all as to why… I am over the moon to announce that I am going to be a Mumma,” the&nbsp;Osbournes alum wrote via Instagram at the time. “To say that I am happy does not quite cut it. I am ecstatic!”</p><p>The Life as We Know It actress also <a href=#>shared two photos</a> of her sonogram along with the news, including one of her gazing at the photo of her future child by the pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2013-An-Evening-With-Women-Sharon-Osbourne-Ozzy-Osbourne-and-Kelly-Osbourne-Osbournes-Family-Album.jpg><p>The news comes a year after&nbsp;Osbourne&nbsp;<a href=#>opened up about her addiction</a>, explaining during an appearance on Red Table Talk that she feels like she wasted time not focusing on her sobriety.</p><p>“I feel very behind. As a woman I would have loved to be married and have children by now,” the Fashion Police star revealed. “My brother [<a href=#><strong>Jack&nbsp;Osbourne</strong></a>] has three daughters, and I would have loved to have a few kids by now, but that wasn’t what was in the cards for me yet.”</p><p>She continued: “And I would have been no kind of mother at all because I was that crazy addict who was like, ‘Oh I will just stop doing drugs when I get pregnant because I have to.'”</p><p>Before falling for Wilson,&nbsp;Osbourne&nbsp;had a variety of whirlwind <a href=#>romances and heartbreaks</a>. The fashion designer was previously engaged to<a href=#><strong> Luke Worrall</strong></a> in 2008 before calling it quits in 2010 after he allegedly cheated on her with model <strong>Elle Schneider</strong>.</p><p>“He is the worst thing that ever happened to me…I have never felt heartbreak like this in my life. I only came home for Xmas to see him meanwhile he has been f—ing hundreds of girls as well as men behind my back,” the singer tweeted following the incident.</p><p>The reality star’s <a href=#>second engagement</a> came a year later in 2011 after meeting vegan chef <strong>Matt Mosshart</strong> at <a href=#><strong>Kate Moss’</strong></a> wedding. The two were together for three years before ultimately deciding to part ways in 2014.</p><p>“It was a mutual decision,” she explained to E! News at the time. “We love each other very much. It just wasn’t the right time for us, and I think if we weren’t as mature and adult than we are, then we could have gone down a road that wasn’t really nice.”</p><p>The So Undercover star’s <a href=#>last relationship</a> before Wilson was with <strong>Eric Bragg</strong>, whom she dated for a year before calling it quits in October 2021. The former couple, while typically private, flaunted their relationship via Instagram Story that January when they&nbsp;washed the cinematographer’s car before the TV personality gave her then-beau a few tips.</p><p><span>“You want to make a balloon animal so every time you look at it, it looks like a frog,” she noted at the time, explaining how to correctly store a hose after use.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bragg declined to comment on their split, but told Us of his ex at the time, “Kelly rules. That’s it. That’s all.”</p><p>Scroll through to see more of Osbourne and Wilson’s friends to lover’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa4y7JkqKuSpMKzusRmmKecXai2pXnWoqOsp56oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kandi-burruss-whats-in-my-bag.html><span>←</span><span>Kandi Burruss: Whats in My Bag?</span></a>
