Shawn Mendes performed at Ella Bikoff’s bat mitzvah, who is the daughter of J. Darius Bikoff, founder and creator of Vitaminwater and Smartwater.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>DRAKE'S SECURITY TEAM BEATS UP SHAWN MENDES</a></strong></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the party itself cost Bikoff an estimated $5 to 7 million, which isn’t much for the multi-millionaire. This wasn’t the first time Bikoff spent an astonishing amount on a private concert; he surprised his wife for their 10th anniversary with a private Justin Timberlake performance costing him $1.3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Shawn was the highlight of the night, the party didn’t stop there in regards to over the top surprises. Bikoff also had 40 to 50 horse carriages waiting to escort the guests from the synagogue to the party, which wasn’t at your run of the mill dancehall, but the extra fancy Plaza Hotel in New York City.</p><p>We’re sure this is a party that daughter Ella will never forget, and a performance we're certain Mendes will be happy to deposit!</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>EMBARRASSING&nbsp;PERFORMANCES THAT ALMOST KILLED CAREERS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3y0tMCwpWallaOxpr%2BMqZyrnp%2BnurR5wZqrZqWZqce3rcdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nancy-brooks-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Nancy Brooks Cause of Death?</span></a>
