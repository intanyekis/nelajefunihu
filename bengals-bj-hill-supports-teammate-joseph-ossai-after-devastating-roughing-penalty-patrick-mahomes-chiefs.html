An incredibly difficult kick, especially considering the freezing cold temperatures and the pressure of the moment.</p><p>However, thanks to the 15-yard penalty on Ossai, the kick was 40 yards ... obviously much easier for <strong>Harrison Butker</strong>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>my heart is heavy for Joseph Ossai. he’s 22 years old & put his whole being into winning this game but arrived at the biggest moment of his life one second too slow. if you raged, gloated or said “how could he” think if this was your son, brother or friend.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/W6YFGUrVNO</a></p>— Jesse Washington (@jessewashington) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@jessewashington</a><p>Ossai was clearly crushed, crying on the bench as the Chiefs celebrated their 3rd trip to the Super Bowl in 4 seasons.</p><p>After the game, Ossai didn't hide ... he stood at his locker and answered questions like a true professional, as 27-year-old Hill, also a defensive lineman, stood by as Joseph talked about the crucial play.</p><p>“These guys mean a lot to me and to know that they have my back is extremely… it’s giving me peace right now,” Joseph told the assembled media.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was the scene at Joseph Ossai’s locker with BJ Hill stepping in to provide support <a href=#>https://t.co/8vn1OOlhOQ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nbUnoCkzfp</a></p>— Michael Niziolek (@michaelniziolek) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@michaelniziolek</a><p>Despite Ossai clearly feeling responsible for the loss, his teammates and coaches, almost to a man (more on that shorlty), have said the 2nd year player is NOT the reason Cinci lost. In fact, during postgame media, head coach <strong>Zac Taylor</strong> attempted to change that narrative, saying one play does not dictate the result of a 60-minute football game.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jermaine Pratt visibly upset with the ending of that game- particularly with the roughing the passer on Joseph Ossai that got the Chiefs in comfortable FG range to win the game <a href=#>#bengals</a> <a href=#>#AFCChampionshipGame</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/02JR77QgG7</a></p>— Katie Kapusta (@KatieKapustaTV) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KatieKapustaTV</a><p>Linebacker <strong>Germaine Pratt</strong> initially erupted in anger after the costly mistake, screaming “What the f***! Why the f*** did you touch the quarterback?” as he walked into the visitor's locker room. But, after he had some time to cool off, Pratt changed his tune while speaking with reporters.</p><p>Now, the Chiefs are preparing to play the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on February 12, and support or not, it's the beginning of a long offseason for the talented and young DE.</p><ul class="social social--permalink"><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--facebook js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2023%2F01%2F30%2Fbengals-bj-hill-supports-teammate-joseph-ossai-after-devastating-roughing-penalty-patrick-mahomes-chiefs%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-fb","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:d2ed6004-ad6d-40cb-879b-4a13e01d878b data-context='{"section":"main","name":"facebook-footer","pos":1}'><span class="icon icon-lg icon-facebook--white social__icon--facebook"></span> Share<span class=social__hide-sm> on Facebook</span></a></li><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--twitter js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2023%2F01%2F30%2Fbengals-bj-hill-supports-teammate-joseph-ossai-after-devastating-roughing-penalty-patrick-mahomes-chiefs%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-tw&text=Bengals%27%20BJ%20Hill%20Shows%20Solidarity%20W%2F%20Joseph%20Ossai%20After%20Devastating%20%27Roughing%27%20Penalty&via=TMZ&related=HarveyLevinTMZ","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:d2ed6004-ad6d-40cb-879b-4a13e01d878b data-context='{"section":"main","name":"twitter-footer","pos":2}'><span class="icon icon-lg icon-twitter--white social__icon--twitter"></span> TWEET<span class=social__hide-sm> This</span></a></li></ul><h3 class="card-section-title related-articles__card-section-title">related articles</h3><a class="related-articles__card-link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=tmz:article:d2ed6004-ad6d-40cb-879b-4a13e01d878b data-context='{"section":"main","name":"related-article","pos":1}'><img width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagez.tmz.com/image/fd/16by9/2023/01/30/fd6ac0f8e1df49dbbfe99670c80a1126_xs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4 class=related-articles__card-title>Brittany Mahomes Trolls Eli Apple With 'Cancun On Three' Tweet After Game</h4></a><a class="related-articles__card-link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=tmz:article:d2ed6004-ad6d-40cb-879b-4a13e01d878b data-context='{"section":"main","name":"related-article","pos":2}'><img width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagez.tmz.com/image/15/16by9/2023/01/30/15a9e8b1fa0649e29c513ace05008591_xs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4 class=related-articles__card-title>Travis Kelce Rips Bengals After Chiefs Win, 'Burrowhead My Ass!'</h4></a><ul class=tag-cloud__list-group><a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":1}'>TMZ Sports</a> <a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":2}'>Football</a> <a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":3}'>Cincinnati Bengals</a> <a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":4}'>NFL</a></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbnZZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmloaGtgZK%2Bmusaao6xlkp96qbXLpWSsraClvLPA0marnpmdoq61sYyjpqydoJ16sL%2FSmqBmmZapsrN5w56tmquklsGqusZmqaitl522r7OMqZynmZypxm68wK2popubYrqitM6mnKxlk522prLSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tori-brixx-who-has-she-dated-boyfriend-net-worth-540516-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tori Brixx?
