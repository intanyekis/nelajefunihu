On Saturday (April 22), the Brooklyn-born rapper posted a song, “Taxi Robber,” which borrows the beat from Fif’s 2005 hit, “Window Shopper,” from the Get Rich or Die Tryin’ soundtrack.

On “Taxi Robber,” Troy took the requisite swipes at Mysonne, rapping: “Mysonne’s a taxi robber/ Mad at me, I think I know why/ Mysonne’s a taxi robber/ He ain’t have $50 to get on Fab’s bus ride."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Linen) was <a href=# rel=noopener>sentenced to seven years in prison</a> after allegedly robbing two taxi drivers in New York City.</p><p>Mysonne, for his part, didn’t take the diss lying down, taking first to his Instagram on Saturday to wish “Roland” (in reference to Troy Ave’s real name, Roland Collins) some much-needed healing.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Coward Culture is at an all-time high,” he wrote. “Once again there is no beef here .. it’s just Real Vs Fake, The internet Vs Real life, and jokes vs Facts.. my only hopes is Roland begin to heal and Take accountability for his poor decisions instead of compounding them.”</p><p>He continued: “It’s always perplexing to me how informants want to fight everyone for calling them informants, I mean if you wanna fight, why didn’t you fight the Case?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Mysonne continued the defense on his YouTube page, pointing out that he first addressed the “controversy” five years ago in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>VladTV</a> where he claimed that he went to jail for a crime he didn’t commit, and then launching into a tirade about Troy Ave’s “snitching” ways.</p><p>“Troy Ave been saying for years that he’s gonna snitch on Taxstone,” his video began. “He even did a song where he said, ‘I’m only loyal to my fam/ Middle finger from the stand.'”</p><p>He then played lyrics from <a href=#>JAY-Z</a>‘s “A Week Ago,” where Hova raps: “You know that’s bad when your sister is mad, when your son gotta grow up like, ‘This my dad?’/ The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar/ You’ll always be in jail, n-gga, just minus the bars,” before posting a message calling Troy Ave out directly.</p><p>“Hey Roland, you can’t steal 50’s whole flow with trash bars,” he wrote. “Knowing he don’t mess with you because you’re a rat. It’s actually sad. I’m praying for you though. But hey, look at the bright side, you’re the ‘coward culture champ,’ guess that means something.”</p><p>He continued: “PS: Get off the Internet and go apologize to that man’s family. And since you got so much money, they should be straight, right? Never gave them a dime! SMH.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>After playing the first verse off of the original “Window Shopper,” Mysonne then cut to 50 Cent’s own less-than-complementary comments about Troy Ave.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if I liked him,” Fif said. “I heard too much of me in the material.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/troy-ave-hits-back-at-chaino-maino-says-he-cant-fuk-with-him-250x142.png alt="Troy Ave Hits Back At ‘Chaino’ Maino, Says He ‘Can’t Fuk’ With Him" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Troy Ave Hits Back At ‘Chaino’ Maino, Says He ‘Can’t Fuk’ With Him</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 2, 2023</p></a><p>Mysonne then cut to another 50 interview — presumably with The Breakfast Club, given the choice of the photo he used in the video — where he, once again, echoed the accusations of Troy Ave biting his style.</p><p>“That’s after you see consistent respect,” he said in response to the suggestion that he should be flattered by the imitation. “Like, if you see it, and the guy gets on the air because he made something that sounds like you, then eventually he could turn around and put his middle finger up to you, and do something different.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Finally, Mysonne cut to an interview with Troy Ave on The Breakfast Club, where he accused 50 Cent of doing a “Pimpin’ Curly” skit — in reference to the popular character originated by Fif during the height of the Thisis50 days — in every song he recorded.</p><p>He then followed that up with a few now-deleted Instagram posts made by the Power mogul that took swipes at Troy Ave, with Casanova even getting into the comments claiming that the B$B rapper was a “federal informant” and that “you can’t fuck with the police.”</p><p></p><p>This is just the latest salvo in the ongoing feud between Mysonne and Troy Ave.</p><p>On April 14, <a class=underline-link href=#>Mysonne dropped “Rolland ( Troy Ave) It ain’t All About The Money,”</a> where he fired off off some scathing bars over the beat to Troy Ave’s 2015 single “All About The Money.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“For you, it’s all about the money my n-gga/ Keep making jokes – I guess this shit is funny my n-gga,” Mysonne rapped. “But you got your man killed, got shot how many times?/ You don’t see how your karma keep coming, my n-gga?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miksqufo7umeZRpZJydnql6tb7OsmSarpViwaLEyGapqJqSmr9uvsSsp6imo5o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./naomi-watts-jacket-amazon-fashion.html><span>←</span><span>Love Naomi Watts $3,950 Designer Jacket?
