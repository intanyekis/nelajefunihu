We’re calling it now. Sure, slides have been a popular footwear choice for decades, but we think this is the year that takes them from simple sandal to statement shoe. Not only are top celebrities and fashion icons wearing them, but their spouses are too! These particular unisex slides are getting major paparazzi time lately, as one of the most-followed and loved couples in the entire world has been photographed wearing them!</p><p>Adidas has always been a go-to for comfortable slides, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adidas Adilette</a> has been enjoying its well-deserved time in the spotlight recently. Not only was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a> spotted rocking her own pair, but so was her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>! Couples that pick out shoes together stay together. Maybe this slipper’s even a part of their love story. Cinderella’s whole “happily ever after” was the result of her own slipper scandal, after all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hailey-Adidas.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adidas Adilette slides</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These slides have over 350 reviews, and of course, nearly all of them are glowing. Many shoppers commented that they’ve been buying and wearing these slides for literally decades, which checks out, as they were originally released back in 1972! Any shoe still being made after that long must be a keeper. As one shopper confirmed, “they last forever.” Many pointed out how comfortable these slides are, one saying they “save [their] feet from fatigue.” They’re so impressive that one shopper said their doctor actually recommended these shoes to them! The “excellent arch support” just could not be beaten.</p><p>When Hailey Bieber was spotted in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adilette slides</a>, she was on her way out of a hot pilates class, her face pink and her flawless skin glowing. She wore a cropped “Colorado” T-shirt and dark <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>, black Adilettes on her bare feet. She completed the post-workout look with a slicked-back half-bun and sunglasses.</p><p>Her husband, Justin Bieber, was recently spotted wearing his own Adilettes (could it be the same pair?) after a trip to church with his wife in Los Angeles. He wore a gray crew neck sweatshirt and black sweatpants as well, letting pink socks peek out from underneath his slides. He topped the look off with a gold chain and a baseball cap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Justin-Adidas.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Adidas Adilette slides</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These Adidas slides are so popular because of a variety of reasons. Looks-wise, they feature the brand’s iconic three stripe logo on the upper, but a slimmer and more streamlined version. This upper is wide and textured, holding firmly to our feet. It also has a soft lining on its bottom side, which helps to prevent irritation. This is especially great if we’re changing into these slippers after a long gym session or run in our <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>!</p><p>The upper is also quick-drying, which complements the water-resistant polyurethane outsole, making these ideal for lounging by the pool or wearing to the beach. The outsole was also designed to have maximum durability and traction, so we should be able to stay on our feet even when a cannonball sends water flying out of the pool!</p><p>The footbed of these slides is contoured to fit our foot’s shape for “ultimate comfort” and support. This shoe will fit almost like a second skin! On the side we’ll find an embossed Adidas logo, which is subtle, taking on the same color as the shoe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Adidas-White.jpg><p>These Adilettes are currently available in three colors. The black version, which we saw on both of the Biebers, has white stripes and is an easy essential we don’t need to think twice about. No stylist’s opinion necessary.</p><p>There’s also Ink Navy, a deep blue with white stripes, and White, which switches things around with a bright sole, footbed and upper, while the stripes are black. The truth is, any of these versions would work with pretty much anything we wear them with, socks or not. That’s kind of the magic of slides. They just work.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These made-in-Italy shoes</a> actually come in a wide selection of versions. These are the celebrity-loved classics, but Adidas also offers cloudfoam Adilettes, patterned ones, shower ones and more, all at Zappos. Pick a favorite, or pick 10 favorites! It can be hard to choose just one, especially with such a comfortable shoe we want to wear even to bed. They’re technically slippers, after all.</p><p>With these classic Adilettes on our side, or more like on our feet, we’re starting to feel a little bit like celebrities ourselves. Now we just need a celebrity spouse to match with.
