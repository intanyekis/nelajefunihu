They also share foster son Jamar Goff.</p><p>In February 2020, the Frontier Follies author <a href=#>talked to Us Weekly</a> about the couple’s relationship.</p><p>“The only thing we agree on, and I reluctantly agree, is that we don’t have dogs in bed with us because he’s not that kind of guy,” the&nbsp;Food Network star told&nbsp;Us exclusively at the time. “Now, I do tell him in jest, joking, I always say, ‘If anything happens to you, the dogs are coming to bed with me.’ That’s how I will console myself because I would have the dogs in my bed.”</p><p>However, the Pioneer Woman can’t sneak the dogs in even for a night while her husband is recovering — he’ll know what she’s been up to.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You know that story&nbsp;Princess and the Pea?” she asked. “He’s the princess in that. He can feel a crumb from 2004 that was once in our bed.”</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarnZVisbPBzKamp5xdqLWivsSsZK6olJbBpnnOp2SfmZ2eubp5zJ6km52iqHqistOeqWasoqqwrHnCqKOloaOevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maureen-shea-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Maureen Shea Wiki [Boxer] Biography Age, Family, Wikipedia, Net Worth, Husband</span></a>
