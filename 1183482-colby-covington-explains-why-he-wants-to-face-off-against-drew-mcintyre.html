I’m not trying to pick on someone smaller than me … I expressed myself to go over to WWE and wrestle, but it sounds like Drew McIntyre expressed himself like he wants to fight, so if WWE doesn’t want to sanction this, we can do this in a [unsanctioned] country, maybe we do it in the UK, maybe we do it in Saudi Arabia, but I think there needs to be a fight between me and Drew McIntyre. you know, David vs. Goliath, I think it’s the perfect billing.”</p><p class=p1>Regardless of what type of fight the two have, it seems as if Covington is very serious about seeing McIntyre in some form. Whether or not the two ever meet has yet to be seen, but if they meet, it will truly be a David vs. Goliath type of matchup on size alone.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"The bigger they are, the harder they fall."<a href=#>@ColbyCovMMA</a> tells <a href=#>@TheMarkHenry</a> & <a href=#>@davidlagreca1</a> why he wants a fight with <a href=#>@WWE</a> Champion <a href=#>@DMcIntyreWWE</a> ?? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oDgOBF5rmJ</a></p><p>— SiriusXM Busted Open (@BustedOpenRadio) <a href=#>April 24, 2020</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBxam1wYmKwsLjBsmScp6aeu6jAzqdknrCgoa6qutJmrqGxXZ2ybsPAp6usZaSkeqetwp5kqJ6WYq6orcinqq1llKeyuHnMnKCnrKmnsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-orakpo-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Orakpo Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
