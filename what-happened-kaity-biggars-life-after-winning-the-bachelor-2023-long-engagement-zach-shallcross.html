But while fans do criticize the hit reality series, it's hard not to get swept up in the promise of two people finding love by the time of the rose ceremony. When Zach Shallcross picked Kaity Biggar in the season 27 finale, it seemed like the right decision. And from what viewers have seen of the couple, they seem like a <a href=#>Bachelor pair that is going to remain together</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that The Bachelor 2023 has aired and fans have found out about Kaity Biggar and Zach Shallcross's engagement, what is Biggar doing? Has being a reality TV star completely changed her life?</p><h2 id=why-did-the-bachelor-39-s-kaity-biggar-and-zach-shallcross-choose-a-long-engagement>Why Did The Bachelor's Kaity Biggar And Zach Shallcross Choose A Long Engagement?</h2><p>Sometimes stars who meet and fall in love on a reality series get married right away. If a couple meets on Netflix's Love Is Blind, they might tie the knot in the season finale. If a couple falls in love on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, fans might think that they will get married within a year. After all, they would want to start their lives together as soon as possible, right?</p><p>Other times, a couple will meet on The Bachelor and have a wild on and off again relationship. That was the case for <a href=#>Kelly Flanagan and Peter Weber, whose romance ended</a> in the spring of 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zach-shallcross-kaity-biggar.jpg><p>While Kaity Biggar and Zach Shallcross got engaged in the season 27 finale of The Bachelor, they aren't married yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Bachelor’s Nick Viall And Natalie Joy’s Relationship Timeline</a></span></p><p>Fans might be shocked by the couple's decision to be engaged for a long period of time. In March 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaity Biggar talked about The Bachelor</a> in an interview with ABC News. She said that while they do still want to tie the knot, a wedding wasn't in their near future.</p><p>Biggar said, "Not right away. I think our whole relationship has just been, like, pedal to the metal, so we're just gonna to take a step back. Probably in the next, like, two years we can foresee a wedding and we've talked about it so, yeah, we're excited."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kaity-biggar-zach-shallcross.jpg><p>It's true that at times, a couple will connect on The Bachelor and viewers will think that they don't really care about each other. That doesn't seem to be the case for Biggar and Shallcross. As viewers saw, he had feelings for Gabi Elnicki, and he chose Biggar over her. Shallcross knew that he wanted to be with Biggar and the finale episode felt very genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the couple was interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter in spring 2023, Shallcross agreed with Biggar that they wouldn't get married soon. He said, "It’s as simple as she’s the love of my life. Not a doubt in my mind. We’ve met each other on a TV show, but it’s so much more than that. We both truly want this to work and know it will work, and it’s a feeling I’ve never had. We’re not rushing to get to the altar. We want to enjoy life together because we have the rest of time to figure it out. I just haven’t felt love this strong."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-the-bachelor-2023-star-kaity-biggar>What Happened To The Bachelor 2023 Star Kaity Biggar?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaity Biggar is from Kingston, Ontario</a>. And as she told local newspaper The Whig Standard, she kept working as a nurse in Austin, Texas after she finished filming The Bachelor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kaity-biggar-restaurant.jpg><p>While her passion for nursing was always clear, fans might be shocked to learn that she and Zach Shallcross lived separately for a little bit after getting engaged in the reality series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Stars Of The Bachelor Reveal What It Really Takes To Get Cast On The Show</a></span></p><p>According to The Whig, she had a job as a nurse at Kingston General Hospital, and then was hired as a nurse in Austin, Texas. She went back to her nursing job after The Bachelor. Shallcross kept his place in California.</p><p>Biggar said, "He hasn’t moved to Austin (from California) yet. He’s actually coming to Austin tonight."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zach-shallcross.jpg><p>The Bachelor star also said that she was able to have a regular life again because she was still able to fly under the radar. She told The Whig, “Patients haven’t recognized me yet. It’s funny, though, because I’ve walked into a patient’s room when ‘The Bachelor’ is playing, and I’ve been on the TV and they don’t even recognize me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Biggar continued to The Whig, "It’s so funny. I always have makeup on (when I’m) onscreen, but when I’m nursing, I don’t have any makeup on, so maybe that’s why, but who knows? There have been some nursing students, some people that I work with who’ll ask for a picture and whatnot, but for the most part, it hasn’t been overbearing or anything.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bachelor In Paradise's Bartender Wells Adams Has Very Mixed Feelings About His Role On The Show And So Do The Fans</a></span></p><p>The Bachelor fans might have thought that Kaity Biggar would leave her regular job and become a social media influencer. This is what many have done after their seasons have ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kaity-biggar-dog.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah Brown, for example, was a cast member in The Bachelor season 23 and then was The Bachelorette in season 27. She got a much larger Instagram following after these appearances and now promotes brands on her social media. She also wrote a book called "God Bless This Mess" and has a podcast called Better Tomorrow With Hannah Brown.</p><p>In contrast, Kaity Biggar has 300,000 Instagram followers, which is smaller than it could be. She mainly posts when she's going out with friends and from her profile, she feels like she's still a regular person who enjoys the things that she always did.</p><p>In July 2023, Biggar shared some photos of her and Zach Shallcross and wrote "Officially roommates" in the caption. They are now in Austin, Texas together. And while The Bachelor fans might be shocked to find out that they did live away from each other after their season of the reality show ended, everything seems to be great now. Shallcross commented on the photo and said that Biggar is great at home decor, which was sweet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXaCuqsDYZpmin5eWv7R5y6KdnmWRm8GmvoywoKemmaO0bsDHnmSbmZOdsq270WZpaWpjYrmwusZmnKefkZyyrrHNrWSzmZOderS0wKWjnKqfqMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Hiroshi Mikitani Net Worth How Much is Hiroshi Mikitani Worth?</span></a>
