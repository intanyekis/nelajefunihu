Despite his affability, the star has had his fair share of personal and public controversies, which have slightly tarnished his reputation.</p><p>Although Grant has managed to overcome many of his scandals over the years, continuing to star in such films as Wonka and Dungeons and Dragons, he occasionally still finds himself at the center of headlines that scrutinize his past actions. But what does Hugh Grant's wife, television producer Anna Eberstein, think of her husband's past scandals and, more specifically, the infamous cheating scandal he had when he was dating fellow actress Elizabeth Hurley?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-hugh-grant-39-s-wife-anna-eberstein-think-about-his-cheating-scandals>What Does Hugh Grant's Wife Anna Eberstein Think About His Cheating Scandals?</h2><p>In 1995, Hugh Grant was at the height of fame after starring in many successful films. However, later that same year, his life would turn upside down when it was revealed that <strong>Grant cheated on his then-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley with s** worker Divine Brown</strong>, also known as Estella Marie Thompson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-11.jpg><p>Police later apprehended the actor, along with Brown, after they caught the two engaging in explicit acts in a parked car in Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/drew-barrymore-and-hugh-grant-s-awkward-encounter-caused-confusion-about-their-relationship-and-whether-they-ever-dated-copy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Drew Barrymore And Hugh Grant's Awkward Encounter Caused Confusion About Their Relationship And Whether They Ever Dated</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Among the highlights of Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant's decades-long friendship is a bizarre encounter that could've ignited a romantic connection.</span><p>At the time, the news industry was dominated by various headlines concerning Grant's shocking behavior.

People keep giving me tons of ideas on this one. I keep reading new psychological theories and stuff like that. You know, I was under pressure, or I was overtired, stuff like that...I was lonely, I fell down the stairs as a child, or whatever. But I think that would bullocks, really, to hide behind something like that. I think you know in life, pretty much, what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing. I did a bad thing, and there you have it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also stated in an interview with The New York Times:</p><p>Last night, I did something completely insane.

Everyone in it was brilliant, but I was so atrocious that I was not in a good frame of mind. I had a Ken Russell kind of lunch – and one thing led to another. I just was disappointed in myself. I don't know what was going on. It [the movie] was called Nine Months.
