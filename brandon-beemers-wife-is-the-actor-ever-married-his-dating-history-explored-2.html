His soft side only came out in front of the love of his life and future wife, Belle.</p><p>Recently, he opened up about the character, dishing out the regrets and dreads that ensured in his runtime.

They were co-stars in Days of our Lives, and they met on the sets as sparks flew.</p><p>Her mother, Fary, was rather critical of their coupling, as she used to leave no room for a cordial relationship. She was adamant that he was not good enough for her&nbsp;baby, calling him stupid and arrogant of his face.</p><p>The hatred bore no bounds as she threatened to hurt them if they even thought of getting married.</p><p>But she had already found her true love after she and her entrepreneur husband Grant Turnbull welcomed their baby Torin in 2016.</p><p>They met after she had just parted ways with her ex-lover and was in no mood to get out of the house. Her friend Dilson Schild swooped in with an invitation and was convinced to attend a lavish party at the Hollywood Hills. The rest was history as they hit it off well and married in a lavish reception in Palm Springs.</p><p>But Beemer was not far behind as he began dating American actress Cherie Thibodeaux in 2014. They did not make it past a few movie premieres until Canadian actress Jessica Lucas caught his eye.</p><p>They lasted for a few months before their relationship went downhill.</p><p>Sadly, he has no plans of saying the holy vows, as he had enough on his plate.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brandon-beemer-net-worth-2022></span>Brandon Beemer Net Worth 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2022, the net worth of actor&nbsp;Brandon Beemer&nbsp;gets calculated to reach at least two million dollars.</p><p>Indeed, he is few of the lucky ones who did not have to struggle for long as he directly landed the part of Shawn-Douglas Brady on Days of Our Lives, descending on TV screens in 2006. The smart and dedicated character stole hearts as his brooding face lit a fire in fans’ souls.</p><p>The character had its share of ups and downs, but his primary focus remains on his family, especially in the storyline with the love of his life Belle. She was his guiding light, who inspired him to be the best version of himself.</p><p>Even audiences gushed about their chemistry as she humanized his animosity.</p><p>Besides, he and his co-star&nbsp;Martha Madison applied comfort to their real-life relationship and had an understanding. They talk about everything from his dates to Jimmy, his dog, as they are best friends.</p><p>In 2008, the network suddenly announced their departure from the series, leading audiences to speculate if he had gotten fired. But he did have to stay unemployed too long as he joined the cast of The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>Owen Knight incorporated into his personality after playing the role for four years and received immense love and respect.</p><p>Meanwhile, he decided to share his life through a docu-series, Dirty Soap, where he was one of the five&nbsp;soap opera&nbsp;stars who documented their lives on E!</p><p>Since then, his gigs have been few and far between, as he appeared on Michelle Stafford’s comedy series The Stafford Project while starring in the horror-thriller film Fear Clinic.</p><p>Fans rejoiced in 2015 after he reprised his role in the drama and will continue to do so till he gets sick of it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brandon-beemer-family></span>Brandon Beemer Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandon Beemer comes from a family of Irish and German ancestry, as he always had a crazy imagination.</p><p>Born in Eugene, Oregon, on February 27, 1980, he got the middle name&nbsp;Richard. People around him knew he was deemed for greatness as he was known for his eccentric personality.</p><p>But acting was a faraway thought as he had other aspirations.</p><p>During his time at Willamette High School, he got known as the sporty type who was bound to get to college by acquiring scholarships.</p><p>Although his future seems brighter, he forsook his up-and-coming career after getting recruited by modeling agencies and headed to New York. A company had already offered him a contract as he got paid by the hours.</p><p>The cash inflow did not feed the creative animal that resided underneath him as striking the same pose day after the day started boring.</p><p>Thinking he needed a fresh start, he traveled to Los Angeles, where he got his big break as the new Shawn-Douglas Brady. It was the start of a new life as most of his gambles bore him bigger and better prizes than the previous ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqilrulu81mmZ6dnZq%2FtHnWop2eZZmoerW0xGaYnKyfp3qmwsSrZKaZoqe2prCMoaCsZZSWwaq6xmafoqukpL%2B6ecSxp6Wnopqxbn6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-pelosi-net-worth-lifestyle.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Pelosi Net Worth &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
