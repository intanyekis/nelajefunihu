Oates’ intentions to sell his portion of Primary Wave Music, an independent music publisher, allegedly violates the terms of their business contract. (The contract’s terms have not been publicly revealed.)</p><p class=p1>A judge in Nashville unsealed part of the lawsuit on Wednesday, November 22. Per the AP, the judge granted Hall a restraining order to <a href=#>temporarily block the sale</a> during the ongoing legal proceedings. The judge ruled that Oates, and others involved in his trust, can’t close the sale of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to a private investment firm until either an arbitrator in a separate case responds or the judge’s restraining order expires.</p><p class=p1>The judge’s ruling was issued on the same day that Hall filed his lawsuit. <i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed on Wednesday that Hall<a href=#> filed an undisclosed complaint</a> and a motion for a temporary restraining order. A later order from the judge allowed more details to become available.</p><p class=p1>Neither Hall nor Oates have publicly addressed the legal drama. <i>Us </i>has reached out for comment.</p><p class=p1>The two musicians formed their eponymous band in 1970, going on to release 18 studio albums. Their final album, a holiday record, dropped in 2006. Hall and Oates last toured together in October 2022, one month after Hall downplayed their working relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/daryl-hall-sued-john-oates-for-attempting-to-sell-his-share-of-primary-wave-music-01.jpg><p class=p1>“I don’t have a partner. You say John Oates is my partner? … He’s my business partner. He’s not my creative partner,” Hall quipped during an appearance on <strong>Bill Maher</strong>’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Club Random” </a>podcast in September 2022. “John and I are brothers, but we are not creative brothers. We are business partners. We made records called Hall & Oates together, but we’ve always been very separate, and that’s a really important thing for me.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “We are not acrimonious in any way. We’re friends. We just have different directions and have had since about 1975.”</p><p class=p1>Hall & Oates’ music catalog was acquired by Primary Wave in 2007. By 2021, Hall seemingly regretted transferring the tracks’ ownership from BMC to Primary Wave.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Oh, in the early days, it got sold off for me and I didn’t get the money,” Hall told <a href=# rel=noopener>Sky News</a> in May 2021, without mentioning a firm by name. “I have a bit of my publishing, but a lot of bad business was done in the early days — I’m a real rock and roll story when it comes to that kind of thing. Never sell your publishing — maybe if you’re, you know, 80 years old and you decided to retire, then you can sell your publishing, but I wouldn’t even suggest it then, I don’t believe in that concept. It’s all you have is that.”</p><p class=p1>Oates, for his part, recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>UltimateGuitar.com</a> that their band would not make another record together. “I’d never say no to anything, but I doubt it. I think Daryl and I have moved beyond it, I really do,” he said during an interview published in July. “The future of Hall & Oates is in the past.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoKlisaK%2B2KVkoZmcoXqntcuem2aZXaeytMDRmqCnoZ6cerC%2Bw56pZpmXlravv9NmoaignmK8osDErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-bruce-boxleitner-wife-children-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Bruce Boxleitner?
