You’ll regret it in college.’ And I’m so glad I didn’t. I like them. They’re my best friends.”</p><p>Although she now loves her bust, Sydney explained that she used to cover “my body up at such a young age.”</p><p>“Once I became more confident with myself, [it changed]. I want to show girls that it’s amazing and beautiful and empowering to have the bodies that we have,” she preached, adding, “Everybody’s body is beautiful. When you are confident and you’re happy within is when it really shows to other people. … Flaunt what you got. Own it. Love them.”</p><p>During a video for Glamour’s “Unfiltered” series, Sydney shared that brands including Miu Miu and Armani — whom she serves as an ambassador for — always cater to her figure, creating and reconstructing gowns to complement her chest and help her feel more confident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dia-Dipasupil-Getty-Images3.jpg><p>“That’s when you see I look more confident and happy on the carpet,” she praised, noting that with other designers “we’re not allowed to cut or alter stuff, so I’m forced to fit in something that doesn’t fit me, and it won’t look right.”</p><p>While promoting her upcoming movie,<a href=#> Anyone But You</a>, in Australia this month, Sydney wore a fabulous Miu Miu gown featuring a square neckline, spaghetti straps, a sheer skirt that exposed her nude underwear, a black leather belt and crystal embellishments. She teamed the look with long nails, silver rings, open-toe heels and diamond earrings.</p><p>For glam, Sydney donned soft makeup including sparkly eyeshadow, filled-in eyebrows, bronzed and rosy cheeks, a highlighted nose and glossy lips. She topped the look off with her blonde locks twisted into an updo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On the red carpet, Sydney posed with costar <strong>Glen Powell</strong>, who opted for a navy blue double-breasted suit. He completed his ensemble with a white T-shirt and black shoes.</p><p>Anyone But You premieres in theaters on Friday, December 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6jGpbrEsmSsr5Wau6bFjK6qnpxdqbxussSeo2atnpi8rrLOq6uampyaeqKuzq6rZqCVp3qjvsSaqq1lo57Hpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./babyname.html><span>←</span><span>Shanti - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</span></a>
