Perhaps one of the most notorious polygamous families of all time, thanks to their exposure on TLC,<a href=#> the Brown family has faced a series of ups and downs</a>, all while the cameras continue to roll.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The latest strain facing this family is the realization that Kody Brown has failed to maintain happy relationships with his wives. <a href=#>Their relationships are failing, and tensions are running high.</a> This isn't quite the way that Kody or any of his wives imagined their lives would unfold, but it seems he's having troubles keeping the different pieces of his life together.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-wasn-39-t-giving-the-wives-equal-attention><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kody Brown Wasn't Giving The Wives Equal Attention</span></h2><p>Polygamous families are intended to bond, support, and care for one another. The families thrive by being respectful of one another's individuality, as well as being able to function well within their united place in the family unit. Finding balance is key, but it seems this is precisely where Kody Brown has failed. For a long time now, Kody's time spent with each of his wives has demonstrated lack of balance, and they're struggling with the concept of not getting equal attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Inside Look At 'Sister Wives' Star Christine Brown's Life Since Marrying Kody Brown</a></span></p><h2 id=robyn-was-getting-too-doted-on><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Robyn Was Getting Too Doted On</span></h2><p>Robyn is arguably Kody Brown's favorite wife, and sadly, all the other wives are well afraid of this fact. The idea of Kody having an obvious 'favorite' is very troubling to the other wives who have always been told to treat one another equally. Kody's actions have been deeply hypocritical, and the fact that he has opted to dote on Robyn to such a degree has caused unsettling waves between the other wives that are affected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jealousy-was-prevalent-among-the-sister-wives><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jealousy Was Prevalent Among The Sister Wives</span></h2><p>Kody's inability to remain balanced with his affection has been the source of jealousy between the wives, and they're no longer able to function as a family unit. Their jealousy is now forming a barrier between the wives, making it impossible for them to cohabitate peacefully.</p><p>The family is not relating to one another in the manner that a polygamous network is supposed to connect, and this has put the wives against one another, rather than uniting them. Sources reveal that Meri, Janelle, and Christine have indicated they've <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from depression</a> and state that they've endured too much loneliness for an extended period of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meri-brown-39-s-catfish-incident-demonstrates-neglect><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Meri Brown's Catfish Incident Demonstrates Neglect</span></h2><p>Audiences were stunned to learn that Meri was guilty of catfishing for attention and affection, and this was a clear example of the fact that she was being neglected by her husband. The fact that she had to seek attention from someone else online spoke to the fact that <a href=#>Kody wasn't giving her the time or support </a>that she so desperately required of her husband. Once again, Kody's inability to balance the relationships he has with all his wives rises to the surface.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>10 Questions Fans Still Have About 'Sister Wives'</a></span></p><h2 id=the-wives-spent-too-much-time-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Wives Spent Too Much Time Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of the reason there is so much tension between the wives is the fact that they're stuck spending far too much time together, since Kody isn't engaging as much as he used to. Now that Kody seems detached from his relationships and is failing to spend equal amounts of time with his wives, the time shared between the wives is increased so dramatically that it's almost too intense for them to handle.</p><h2 id=intimacy-is-non-existent-with-meri><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Intimacy Is Non-Existent With Meri</span></h2><p>Meri and Kody have been experiencing challenges with intimacy, to the point that it has been stated that their sex life is essentially ''nonexistent.' Kody has said that he believes they can reconnect one day, but at this moment in time, he doesn't feel even remotely attracted to Meri, and as such, they're not sharing intimate time with one another. This is making her even more jealous of Robyn and is leaving Meri feeling unsatisfied and unloved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-39-s-making-meri-jump-through-hoops><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He's Making Meri Jump Through Hoops</span></h2><p>Meri Brown is being made to feel as though she needs to win back Kody's attention, and she has tried to create moments of intimacy between them, in an effort to repair her marriage. Sadly, the more she tries, the more it seems Kody declines her advances, and Meri is made to feel rejected and invisible. She has put forward a variety of different attempts to earn back Kody's affection, but nothing seems to get him to focus on her in a meaningful way. He rejected her advances on their anniversary, which was especially painful.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Meri Brown Has Exposed About Her 'Sister Wives' Marriage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=housing-complexities-are-too-intense><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Housing Complexities Are Too Intense</span></h2><p>Kody Brown thinks all his wives and children should live in the same house. It has become too taxing for him to attend to each of his wives' households and invest time and energy in each one. However, the wives are so bitter about the way they've been neglected by him that they're refusing to move forward with this idea. Robyn doesn't even want to purchase a home at all - she prefers to rent and save money, which is causing a huge stalemate between her and Kody. The most basic conversations about living situations seem to be a huge struggle.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-said-to-have-a-poor-attitude><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He's Said To Have A Poor Attitude</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kody Brown is said to have a very poor attitude these days, and that's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">weighing heavily on the Sister Wives</a>. He is getting fed up with the way his relationships are breaking down and is starting to become bitter in his approach. He was insisting that Meri flirt with him to reignite the spark between them, then would repeatedly turn her down after she attempted precisely what he asked of her. Kody's behavior has made him less desirable and had added strain to lives of each of his wives.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-constantly-complains-about-his-wives><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kody Brown Constantly Complains About His Wives</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kody's constant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whining and complaining about his wives</a> is becoming exhausting and overwhelming. Fans state his change of attitude has been obvious, and he seems that when he's not complaining about his four wives, he's mocking them in a manner that is being seen as demeaning and unfair. The state of his life is one that he is incredibly unhappy with, but rather than making a change, he's grumbling about it and becoming jaded and bitter, which is very off-putting to his family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Is Meri Brown Leaving 'Sister Wives'?
