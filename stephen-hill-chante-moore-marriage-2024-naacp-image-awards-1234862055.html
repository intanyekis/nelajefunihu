Still learning and I love that about us,” said Moore as her husband of <a href=#>almost two years</a> chuckled in the background. “We’re present in <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234851285>our relationship</a>. It’s not about being perfect; it is about giving all you got. And whether or not we have a good day or a bad day, we’re in this love together.

Look, I am so thrilled to be at my advanced age and have this much love in my life. It’s just the greatest thing. I feel like a 30-year-old.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m 35. I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” quipped the <a href=#>R&B Divas: L.A.</a> alum, smiling. Their banter was too cute as he rebutted, “That’s because I like older women.” In actuality, Hill is 62 while Moore is 57.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Of their love, he called it “the greatest thing,” adding, “I revel in it, I live in it, and it makes me smile all the time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Though Moore admitted that she doesn’t sing her classic ballad, “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234714390>Chanté’s Got A Man</a>,” to her man, she open up about their relationship and stated, “Thank God he found me. I had to keep hope alive.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=587782>former BET executive</a>, he is a fan of the record and revealed that his favorite performances of it are when his mother is around. During the part when Moore sings, “Took me home to meet his mama/ How he loves me,” Hill confessed, “I’d nudge mom and she’d say, ‘She’s talking about you.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out our full chat with Mr. and Mrs. Hill above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBprzHnqVmoJmhuW6vx5qlrZ1dorywvsRmpJqqop6uqLGMa2drbF2jrqKvz2agppmXmnqiw8Crm6xlYWeAdYSVa2dubV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./micah-hyde-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Micah Hyde Wife, Amanda Hyde [2023 Update]</span></a>
