McCaslin spoke about how he’s preparing to get back on tour with the band, comparing it to a wrestler getting back in ring shape.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m a little stressed about that because normally we don’t have a lot of time between tours. It’s like a week or two, so I’m in ‘tour shape’ all the time, but we haven’t played since the end of February 2020. Other bands, like Green Day did that big stadium tour last year and bands have been doing stuff,” McCaslin explained, “we just haven’t. We’ve been recording, we have a double album that’s coming out later on, but we haven’t played any shows. I’m kinda getting into — and this tour is going to be an anniversary tour for our first full-length album, All Killer, No Filler — so we’re playing all of those songs, which I’m happy about because back then, we weren’t very good. [laughs]</p><p>“I started re-learning some of the songs we haven’t played in a while, like ‘Oh right, four chords. This is going to be easy.’ I think the hard part is going to be the stamina because when you get on stage it’s like wrestling, you have to get ready to going into the ring. It’s like going into the ring and I’m not a big runner,” he noted.</p><p>Paquette then asked McCaslin to share his workout routine and also noted that his wife was a personal trainer. McCaslin said that he can’t get into doing a “real” routine and needs his own program.</p><p>“We have a little gym in our basement, but I don’t want to be beside anyone and have to talk to them while I’m sweating and huffing. I’m a little out of shape, and that’s why I’m running and constantly trying to work out because I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve got two weeks until I go on stage.’ I don’t want to be gasping for air and trying to talk to [the band] next to me, so I’m just doing it on my own time.”</p><p>SUM 41 <a href=# rel=noopener>recently announced</a> a new double album,&nbsp;Heaven & Hell, which is on the way in the near future.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Their tour</a> with Simple Plan kicks off on April 29 in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFyaG1raGLAtrmMbWhmopGovK95wqilnmWdmLCiv8uipWasn6q%2Fbr%2FHmqeeZaKeu6h50Z6YnbE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-paul-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Paul Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
