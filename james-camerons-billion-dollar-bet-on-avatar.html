A major figure in the post-New Hollywood era, he is considered one of the industry's most innovative filmmakers, regularly pushing the boundaries of cinematic capability with his use of novel technologies, James Cameron finished the first <i>Avatar</i> film, his kids called a family meeting to deliver some notes on his parenting. Some of the kids, who today range in age from 15 to 32, had attended the MUSE school in Calabasas that Cameron’s wife, Suzy Amis Cameron, founded in 2006. At MUSE, students are encouraged to provide feedback to their teachers, and now the Cameron brood was emboldened to apply that same technique at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Here's Why Most James Cameron Movies Are Big Budget</b></a></span></p><p>According to the <a href=#><i>Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, Cameron is known in the film business for getting what he wants when he wants it, from release dates to budgets to the right to mount elaborate oceanic expeditions on a studio’s dime. The director admits he has sometimes brought his hard-driving style home, and there are moments when his fathering has resembled the Robert Duvall character in <i>The Great Santini</i>, the relentless Marine colonel patriarch. “I’m on a rules-based universe, and the kids weren’t into it,” Cameron says. “They said, ‘You’re never around half the time. And, then, when you come home, you try to make up for it by telling us all what to do. And Mom’s really the one that’s been making all the rules the whole time while you’ve been off shooting. So you don’t get to come home and do that.'” (The Camerons have three children together and one each from a previous marriage — his to Linda Hamilton, hers to Sam Robards.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron says he took the kids’ note, that he tries to listen more and control less. “I thought, ‘Well, that’s valid,'” he says. “I realized I was wearing the mantle of responsibility of a parent and overcompensating for the time I wasn’t there.”</p><p>Perhaps more than any new camera system or giant media merger, the humbling experience of parenting teenagers has had the greatest impact on how Cameron made his latest movie, both in the choice of subject matter and in the way he managed his cast and crew.</p><p>In <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i>, which Disney will release Dec. 16, Cameron takes the stakes to the home— albeit an alien home, where Mom and Dad are blue and 9 feet tall. “I thought, ‘I’m going to work out a lot of my stuff, artistically, that I’ve gone through as a parent of five kids,'” Cameron says. “The overarching idea is, the family is the fortress. It’s our greatest weakness and our greatest strength. I thought, ‘I can write the hell out of this. I know what it is to be the asshole dad.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>The Way of Water </i>is Cameron’s first film in 13 years, since the original <i>Avatar</i> became the highest-grossing movie of all time ($2.92 billion worldwide), collected nine Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director, and introduced groundbreaking new filmmaking techniques. The sequel cost more than $350 million, and it’s scheduled to kick off a wave of three more <i>Avatar</i> movies, which, if completed, will represent a more than $1 billion investment for Disney on production costs alone.</p><p>It’s early November, and Cameron is at Park Road Post Production, Peter Jackson’s art deco-style facility in Miramar, a suburb of Wellington, the windswept capital of New Zealand that has become a low-key Hollywood Down Under since Jackson filmed the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies here in the early 2000s. Those fantasy films are so central to Wellington’s modern identity that a giant sculpture of Smaug the Dragon greets travelers at the Wellington airport. Cameron is at work on what he hopes will be Wellington’s next great epic, in an office that was once Jackson’s, a stately, wood-paneled room that he has made his own with some stacks of books — Kim Stanley Robinson’s climate change science fiction novel <i>The Ministry of the Future </i>is on top — and a mini-fridge stocked with vegan snacks (he’s been vegan for more than a decade).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron is shuttling between the mixing theaters where the crew is tweaking the sound on the last four of 15 reels — <i>Avatar: The Way of Water </i>will run just over three hours — and a dark nearby visual effects office that he ducks into to oversee the last 60 or so of the movie’s jaw-dropping 3,350 visual effects shots. At 68, the director looks pretty much like he did on the first <i>Avatar</i> movie. He’s still lean, still wears a motocross jersey and jeans on set, and still focuses so intently on whatever he’s doing at the moment that his crew plays an “awoogah” sound effect of a submarine-style diving klaxon on speakers to get his attention. “I don’t even respond unless they do the ‘awoogah,'” he says.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first <i>Avatar</i> followed paralyzed Marine Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, who takes on an avatar body to travel to the lush planet of Pandora, inhabited by the indigenous Na’vi people, and gets enlisted in a scheme to strip the planet of its precious resource, unobtanium. In the new film, which travels to Pandora’s oceans, Jake is a father and husband to Na’vi princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). Their kids include a teenage Na’vi daughter played, thanks to the magic of visual effects, by Sigourney Weaver, 73, and an adoptive human son, Spider, played by Jack Champion, who is now 18 but was 13 when the film started shooting. Kate Winslet plays a character from another ocean-bound Na’vi clan. Cameron has already shot <i>Avatar 3</i>, due in 2024, and part of <i>4</i> (2026), and he has a script for <i>5</i> (2028). “It’s all written out, stem to stern, four scripts, and fully designed,” Cameron says. “We know exactly where we’re going, if we get the opportunity to do it. And that opportunity will simply be market-driven, if people want it, if they like this movie enough.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3ornErGScmZ2av7C60maZoqScnryvecOoo6WZomKvpsCMqKVmmaaWwaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-kimmel-youtube-team-enabled-comments-joe-biden-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Were Stunned That Jimmy Kimmel's YouTube Team Enabled Comments Following His Disastrous Joe Bid</span></a>
