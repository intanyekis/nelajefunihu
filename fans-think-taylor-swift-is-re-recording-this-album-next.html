With, multiple Grammys under her belt and a fan base that loves her deeply. When it came out that <a href=#>Taylor does not own her first six albums because of Scooter Braun</a>, she decided to re-record them and add all the songs she previously did not when they first came out. Fans are patiently waiting for the next re-recording after Fearless(Taylor's Version) and Red(Taylor's Version) were released in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-taylor-swift-re-recording-her-songs>Why Is Taylor Swift Re-Recording Her Songs?</h2><p>Since Scooter Braun has sold the albums to a label called Shamrock Capital for nearly $300 million, Swift has not stayed quiet about this. Choosing to re-record her albums was a major power move. Many legendary artists have said they gained a tremendous amount of respect for Swift, with <a href=#>the likes of Dave Grohl saying they're "scared" of the songstress</a>.</p><p>Taylor chose to re-record Fearless first. Fearless is her second album and one dear to fans. It features one of her most popular songs, 'Love Story.' Taylor said, <a href=#>"Deciding on what album to re-record first was pretty easy for me."</a> With the release of her first re-recorded album, fans were treated to additional songs that didn't make the album the first time around. These were called "(From The Vault) (Taylor's Version)." <a href=#>Many of these tracks featured artists that Taylor is close to, including Keith Urban and Maren Morris</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Fans React To Her Pulling 'Fearless' Album Out Of The Grammy's</a></span></p><p>Fearless (Taylor's Version) was extremely successful and left fans wanting to know which re-recording would be next.</p><p>In June 2021, Swift announced Red (Taylor's Version) would be next. Red is her fourth studio album. She announced the re-recording would feature all thirty songs meant to be on the original album and that one of the songs was even ten minutes long. Fans immediately knew she was talking about the track 'All Too Well.' And they were right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Red (Taylor's Version) was a success and the vault tracks included artists, Phoebe Bridgers and Chris Stapleton. The 'All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)' was a fan favorite. It is reportedly about Jake Gyllenhaal and their tumultuous relationship back in 2012. Taylor released a short film to go along with the song as well. It gained so much traction and criticism about Gyllenhaal that he came out with a statement responding to the song and if it was about him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said it was not</a>, but fans totally think otherwise.</p><h2 id=what-album-is-taylor-swift-re-recording-next>What Album Is Taylor Swift Re-Recording Next?</h2><p>It has been four months since Red (Taylor's Version) has been released and fans are wondering which album is next up. They even have some theories. Even subtle hints like an Instagram post Taylor made in which she was wearing an outfit for the BRITs award show that fans thought looked like the 1989 album fashion era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September, Swift dropped 'Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)' off of 1989 after it became a trending sound on TikTok. This fed into the theory that 1989 would be next. She referenced "going down a rabbit hole" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, leading fans to believe that was an Eastern egg hint for the track 'Wonderland' from the 1989 Deluxe Edition. In the 'I Bet You Think About Me' music video, <a href=#>Swift is seen destroying a red velvet cake</a> similar to the one featured in 'Blank Space' music video a song from 1989.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Taylor Swift Album Is The Most Successful?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 'I Bet You Think About Me' music video also has references to the Speak Now album. Speak Now is Taylor's third album and features a song called 'Enchanted.' This song went viral on TikTok this year, so many fans have been hoping that will prompt Swift to release Speak Now (Taylor's Version)next. In the 'Enchanted' music video, Swift wears a dress that looks like the wedding dress from the new 'IBYTAM' video from Red (Taylor's Version). The 'Speak Now' title track is about an ex-girlfriend ruining a wedding in hopes of being with the groom, which is the idea of the 'IBYTAM' video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been seen rocking purple lipstick</a>, which is the color scheme of the Speak Now album.</p><h2 id=what-can-fans-expect-from-the-upcoming-re-records>What Can Fans Expect From The Upcoming Re-Records</h2><p>Fans can expect vault songs which will include features from other artists of Swift's choosing, slight differences to some songs, and new cover art, of course. In Red (Taylor's Version), Swift changed the song 'Girl at Home' to be more upbeat and fans loved it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></span></p><p>Although it is not confirmed by Swift or her team which album will be next to be re-recorded, the fans' theories will keep coming. Whether it is 1989,Speak Now, or any other of Swift's albums, it is guaranteed to be a success just like her others. For now, fans will have to wait to hear from Swift herself and enjoy Fearless(Taylor's Version) and Red(Taylor's Version).</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Easter Eggs We Discovered In Taylor Swift’s Music Videos">Easter Eggs We Discovered In Taylor Swift’s Music Videos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2ewG6%2BxGapnpufp7GqusZmq6Gho2Kura7UpmSnnaipfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-pryme-qvc-death-obituary-what-happened-to-qvc-chris-pryme-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Pryme Qvc Death Obituary: What Happened to QVC Chris Pryme Husband?</span></a>
