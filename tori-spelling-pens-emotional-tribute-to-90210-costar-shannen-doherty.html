She gave me the belief I had a voice and was worthy. We became fast best friends. We were each others wing women, true confidantes, support systems navigating bad relationships, roomates of sorts at times, travel buddies, and so much more.”</p><p>Spelling noted that Doherty “always” stuck up for her, had her back and “believed in me when I didn’t or couldn’t believe in myself.”</p><p>“We were young,” Spelling continued. “We let a lot of outside and inside influences influence our friendship. In a world where we often don’t get to make up with the childhood friendships that formed so much of the adult you become, we got that chance.”</p><p>Spelling added that she’s “grateful” that she and Doherty “got to go back in time as adult friends and remember why we truly loved each other to begin with.”</p><p>“To reminisce. And, to iconically laugh again like we used to,” she wrote. “No one could make me laugh like that. Core laughs!”</p><p>Spelling called Doherty “a rebel in an era when most women didn’t feel comfortable being strong.” Spelling added, “She never tried she just was. She empowered sexiness, strength, 2 f–ks given, empathy, and all topped off with wicked humor! Her sardonic humor was one of my faves. And, no one made a frito pie like Shan!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Feature-Tori-Spelling-Pays-Tribute-to-Shannen-Doherty.jpg><p>Alongside the message, Spelling shared several throwback photos with Doherty. Spelling concluded, “Shan… I’ll carry the torch on. Take on my power! And, I’ll stay rebellious for you. Love you with all my heart. Always. 🖤💔.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed on Sunday, July 14, that Doherty died at the age of 53 following a <a href=#>lengthy battle with cancer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/90210-Tori-Spelling-Pays-Tribute-to-Shannen-Doherty.jpg><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty.
