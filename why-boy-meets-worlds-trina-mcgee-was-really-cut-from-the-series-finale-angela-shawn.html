Much of the storyline centered around Cory, his brother Eric (Will Friedle), his best friend Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong), and his girlfriend Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel). Very often, they got advice and life lessons from their teacher and neighbor, George Feeny (William Daniels).</p><p>New characters were added in later seasons. Matthew Lawrence played Jack, who was Eric's roommate, and we learn is also Shawn's half-brother. Shawn falls for Angela, played by Trina McGee, and the two become involved in the last few seasons.</p><p>The series ends when Cory and Topanga get married. The couple, plus Shawn and Eric, move to New York City. Angela did not appear in the series finale.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rider Strong And Ben Savage “Didn’t Get Along That Well” When Boy Meets World First Began</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-39-pod-meets-world-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Is 'Pod Meets World'?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pod Meets World</a> was created by Boy Meets World Stars Danielle, Will and Rider. The three watch each episode of the series one by one and discuss. They share their memories and behind the scenes moments with their audience.</p><p>Thirty years after the last episode, the three talk about both the good and the bad. They often have guests who starred on the show with them, and those who worked on the show. Even everyone's favorite, Mr. Feeny, joined the podcast to talk about his experience working with the teens.</p><h2 id=why-isn-39-t-ben-savage-part-of-the-podcast><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Isn't Ben Savage Part Of The Podcast?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Savage as Cory Matthews was the central character in Boy Meets World. <a href=#>But he is not hosting the podcast with his former co-stars.</a></p><p>On the very first episode, Danielle explained Ben's absence, “Ben Savage is doing his own thing. He’s doing Lifetime movies. He’s busy. We would love for him to have been a part of the show. We asked him to be a part of the show."</p><p>She went on to say, “We talked about it with Ben and Ben was like, ‘I’m not sure it’s really my thing,'” she recalled, noting that after they took some meetings, they circled back with him again to make sure he didn’t want to be part of it. “He said, ‘It just really is not my thing,’ and we have respected that. It’s not his thing. That is why Ben is not here.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-finale-of-boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Finale Of Boy Meets World</span></h2><p>The last episode was emotional for everyone involved. The cast and crew were together for years, so it was hard to say goodbye to each other and their characters.</p><p>The two-part finale had Topanga accept an internship in New York. She and Cory move to NewYork. Eric and Shawn do the same. The foursome gets some final advice from Mr. Feeny before they leave.</p><p>But Shawn's long-term girlfriend Angela did not appear in the episode. She left in the prior episode to move to Europe for a year with her father.</p><h2 id=girl-meets-world><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Girl Meets World</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Girl Meets World premiered on Disney Channel. It was a reboot of the original, but this time Cory and Topanga were the parents, and the series centered around their daughter, Riley (Rowan Blanchard). Now, Cory was her history teacher.</p><p>Like her dad, she also had a best friend, Maya (Sabrina Carpenter).</p><p>Many of the original cast reprized their roles, including Rider Strong, Matthew Lawrence, and Trina McGee.</p><p>The series was canceled after three seasons because the characters had aged, and outgrew <a href=#>Disney's target demographic.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Cast Of ‘Girl Meets World’ Is Up To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=did-trina-mcgee-experience-racism-on-the-set-of-boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Did Trina McGee Experience Racism On The Set Of Boy Meets World?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2020, <a href=#>Trina McGee tweeted about racism</a> she experienced on the set of Boy Meets World, and said it continued on Girl Meets World.</p><p>She said that Will Friedle told her she looked like Aunt Jemima when she was wearing red. He has since apologized to her, which she felt was sincere.</p><p>She also recalled being called a "bitter bi**h". When she was asked why she was now speaking out against the racism, she said told Yahoo Entertainment, "I feel like I'm always the one who had to squelch it and move on. What about me? What about all this stuff I'm taking and ingesting in me, and not really totally realizing how much it's lowering my vibration, my self-esteem."</p><h2 id=why-was-trina-mcgee-left-out-of-the-finale><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Was Trina McGee Left Out Of The Finale?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, Trina believed that the other cast members did not want her in the series finale. She was on the series from seasons five through seven but exited the episode before the finale. She always believed that Ben, Danielle and Rider wanted it that way. Until she appeared on Pod Meets World.</p><p>"I was told, in kind of a weird, off-handed way by a very important person," McGee said, "that you guys all went to [showrunner] Michael Jacobs, and you said, 'We don't want her in the last episode. She's somehow taking our light,' was the gist of it."</p><p>She added, "That was really hurtful to me for a long time."</p><p>The three podcast hosts vehemently denied this. Friedle said, "Can we say for the record, Trina, that never happened." He was also upset that someone led her to believe that, "That's not competitiveness, that's sociopathy," he said. "This pisses me off. This is next level."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-danielle-fishel-and-trina-mcgee-friends><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Are Danielle Fishel And Trina McGee Friends?</span></h2><p>Danielle Fishel has said that the cast became much closer after Trina McGee spoke out about racism on the set. Fishel called McGee and apologized for making her feel uncomfortable, and blamed it on personal issues. Trina accepted her apology.</p><p>Danielle tweeted, “I owed @realtrinamcgee an apology for being rude, cold, & distant when she guest starred on GMW (her tweet regarding warm hellos being met with cold blank stares was about me). Trina and I spoke over a month ago and she gracefully accepted my apology.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then Trina posted a tweet with a picture of herself with Fisher and Friedle, “Over the last months with so much tension going on, these two people in this pic with me have really gone out of their way to check on me, show sincerity and healing. I did not expect this but am grateful for this experience. Let the healing begin!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Danielle Fishel Got The Role Of Topanga On Boy Meets World</a></span></p><h2 id=will-there-be-another-boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will There Be Another Boy Meets World?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Savage was recently asked</a> if he would ever consider another Boy Meets World and become Cory Matthews again. He responded, “I’ve learned enough to know that you literally never know what can happen in this business,”</p><p>He also said that he would "never say never". He is just happy that fans still care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7y6ecyenK2rXay8s7jDrGStqpmjrm65wqCcnmWnlsBuvsSao6WxXZjCtXnFq6amZaSdsm6%2FxKugnqtdm7avrcueZJqml5q5onnSoZiwpl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lon-rosen-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lon Rosen Net Worth</span></a>
