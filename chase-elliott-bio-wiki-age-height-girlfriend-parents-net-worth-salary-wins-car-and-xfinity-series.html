She spoke with Autoweek before the STP 500 at Martinsville Speedway:</p><p><strong>Autoweek: When did you and Bill realize Chase might be this good?</strong></p><p><strong>Cindy Elliott:</strong> Probably at 13. He was good in go-karts and had a knack for racing, but not really phenomenal until he got in full-bodied stock cars. That’s when it seemed to click, when he won his sixth start and the Georgia State (Late Model) Championship. He’d always had an ambition and love for it, but everything clicked about then.</p><p><strong>Autoweek: What was the specific race when you saw that talent really break through?</strong></p><p><strong>Cindy Elliott:</strong> Maybe when he won the (2010) Winchester 400 at 14. Bill put a lot of thought into the whole (learning) process, so we went everywhere. After Winchester, we knew we had something special, especially the working relationship between Chase and (crew chief) Ricky Turner.</p><p><strong>Autoweek: What was more stressful, watching Bill then or watching Chase now?</strong></p><p><strong>Cindy Elliott</strong>: Because I have so much confidence in Chase, there’s really no difference. I knew Bill wouldn’t put his car anywhere it wouldn’t go and Chase is the same. He won’t put himself in a position where he doesn’t feel comfortable. I was confident with Bill and I’m just as confident with Chase.</p><p><strong>Autoweek: He seems young to be comfortable in the spotlight.</strong></p><p><strong>Cindy Elliott</strong>: I don’t know if he’s comfortable there; mostly, he’s just comfortable being Chase Elliott. He’s been out here so long and has learned so much from Bill. He was on the pit box and had a (team) radio as a kid, listening to Bill and his crew chief and his spotter. He learned by observing and being around Jeff Gordon and Dale Jr. and Jimmie (Johnson).</p><p><strong>Autoweek: Was there a moment when you wondered exactly what you were getting into?</strong></p><p><strong>Cindy Elliott</strong>: When Chase was 3, my mother said he would become a race-car driver. That was the moment for me. I thought, ‘Where are the golf clubs?’ But you have to support your child’s passion. As long as he’s happy, I’m happy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chase-elliott-girlfriend-kaylie-green-is-he-married></span><span>Chase Elliott Girlfriend <strong>Kaylie Green: Is he married?</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Chase is dating Kaylie Green, daughter of another legendary NASCAR driver David Green.</strong> David Green retired from racing in 2008 and is currently a NASCAR official.
