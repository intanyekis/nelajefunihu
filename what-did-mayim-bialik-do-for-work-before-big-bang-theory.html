She also tutored high school biology, which included teaching sex education to a group of high school students.</p><p>Surprisingly, Mayim landed a job teaching students about sex education. She said, “I taught in the homeschool community. There’s a Jewish homeschool community that meets in Los Angeles and so many of these kids were raised religious and they never had really any kind of sex ed.”</p><p>According to the actress, many of the students had not received any prior sex education due to their religious upbringing. Despite being recognized by some of their parents as the former star of "Blossom," the students themselves were unaware of her previous career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And they were too young to know me from television.
