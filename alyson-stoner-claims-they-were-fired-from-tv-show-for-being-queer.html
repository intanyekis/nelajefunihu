It was intimidating and also liberating.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Suite Life of Zack&nbsp;& Cody</a>&nbsp;</i>alum did not further reveal which TV program or network executives had let them go, but the Ohio native&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon for many years as a child and teen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Alyson-Stoner-Claims-They-Were-Fired-From-Children-Show-for-Being-Queer-Camp-Rock.jpg><p class=p1>Stoner&nbsp;got their big break in 2001 when they appeared on Disney’s&nbsp;<i>Mike’s Super Short Show, </i>one year before<a href=#> landing a leading role</a> in <a href=#><strong>Missy Elliott</strong></a>’s “Work It” music video.

I tried to be patient and stifle the emotions so I could think objectively. Our bond didn’t feel quite sisterly or platonic,” the&nbsp;<i>Alice Upside Down&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>wrote in&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>&nbsp;</i>at the time. “Flashes of her smile progressed to flashes of her wavy hair followed by the curve of her hips through her straight-leg pants. I realized I had never fantasized about a guy this way nor really ever felt comfortable dating guys. Come to think of it, I stared at women’s bodies more than anything. But wasn’t that just societal conditioning or the unattainable beauty standards that fuel comparison and objectification? I refused to entertain other possibilities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapKmovK950q2mp52iYrCtrcimqmasmJrGbsPEq5xmnpmnsqV5xaumpmWkq3q0tM6wZJ%2BnomKvprXNoGSqrZWav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-creans-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Creans Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
