For Bre Tiesi, that fame may have led to better job opportunities, as the star landed a gig on Selling Sunset for its sixth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bre was never a "nobody," despite being most well-known for being the mama to Legendary, <a href=#>Nick's eighth child</a>. But connecting with Nick might have helped her gain visibility in Hollywood, helping her nab a great realtor gig with The Oppenheim Group. But who was Tiesi before she ever met Cannon?</p><h2 id=who-is-bre-from-selling-sunset>Who Is Bre From Selling Sunset?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/why-selling-sunset-fans-are-siding-with-bre-tiesi-amid-feud-with-chelsea-lazkani-over-her-relationship-with-nick-cannon.jpg><p>Bre Tiesi, real name Breana Moran, is a Realtor Associate with The Oppenheim Group as of Selling Sunset's sixth season. Before that, she had a handful of TV appearances, some as herself and some in acting gigs on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her IMDb profile states that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre "soared to stardom"</a> thanks to her acting and modeling work, though only her most ardent followers have likely tracked said career. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre Tiesi's modeling work</a> began unexpectedly, according to an interview she gave in 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Do Nick Cannon's Baby Mamas Feel About Each Other?</a></span></p><p>Tiesi explained that she began modeling in high school around age 16 thanks to a former boyfriend who worked in the industry. In fact, Bre wanted to be a surgical technician prior to that boyfriend's influence; the boyfriend's mom suggested modeling, and Bre went with it.</p><p>She later modeled for Rockstar Energy, gaining more modeling gigs over time. Ultimately, she wound up on Wild 'N Out, which is apparently where she met Nick Cannon.</p><p>Bre's IMDb listing doesn't mention Wild 'N Out, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre confirmed via Instagram</a> she'd been a model for "for almost a decade" as of 2023, but it does include a few mentions of her not-yet-ex-husband, which might be the most interesting skeleton in her closet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-manziel-and-bre-tiesi-were-married-for-three-years>Johnny Manziel And Bre Tiesi Were Married For Three Years</h2><p>Although their marriage began to dissolve long before the official divorce decree, Bre Tiesi and Johnny Manziel were married for around three years, from 2018 to 2021. Manziel is a former NFL quarterback who played for various teams over the years before moving to Fan Controlled Football.</p><p>Though Manziel is clearly not the most famous NFL player on the planet, he is reported to be pals with Drake. He and Bre met in 2017 and were married for roughly a year before announcing they were separating (per IMDb) in 2019.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-johnny-manziel-and-bre-tiesi>What Happened With Johnny Manziel And Bre Tiesi?</h2><p>It's unclear what really happened with Johnny Manziel and Bre Tiesi, although on Bre's side, she has made some claims about Johnny's reported indiscretions. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiesi's friends threw her a divorce party</a> when the paperwork was finalized in 2021, complete with a cake that read "I do. I did. I’m done … Divorced at last."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Selling Sunset Season 6 Drama And Feuds That Left Fans Reeling</a></span></p><p>On an Instagram post commemorating the party, Bre quoted the cake but wrote, "No shade to J, wish you nothing but the best, love ya" with a heart and laugh-crying emoji. Johnny replied with laugh-crying emojis, but this was in stark contrast to Bre's earlier posts about the relationship imploding.</p><p>When the two originally split, NY Post notes, Tiesi removed all photos and mentions of Manziel from her Instagram. Her explanation at the time was simply that "vows were broken." The divorce proceedings began six months later and were initiated by Breana.</p><h2 id=did-bre-leave-johnny-for-nick-cannon>Did Bre Leave Johnny For Nick Cannon?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nick-Cannon-announces-Bre-Tiesis-pregnancy-on-The-Nick-Cannon-Show-via-YouTube-Nick-Cannon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, it doesn't seem that Bre Tiesi has come out and explicitly said that Johnny Manziel cheated on her, even if that was what her original 'broken vows' comment implied. Given that she captioned her divorce party post with "love" for Johnny, could it be that he wasn't the one who broke vows?</p><p>Some speculate that Bre may have cheated on Johnny with Nick Cannon, given that she has worked on Wild 'N Out for so long; Nick has worked on the show since 2005. There's also the fact that, two months after revealing her pregnancy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bre stated that she and Nick had "had our on-and-off for years"</a> but that she has "always come back."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nick Cannon Loves Having Kids, But Did He Ever Want More With Mariah Carey?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Tiesi didn't say how many years, it's up to fan speculation as to when she and Nick met, and whether that was during Bre's marriage—either before or after she separated from Manziel. However, in another interview, per Us Magazine, Bre Tiesi stated that she and Nick had "dated on and off for nearly 10 years."</p><p>Further, she made it clear that, <a href=#>like other members of their larger family, she and Nick planned</a> their son Legendary, waiting until they were both ready to have a child, and she has praised him for being involved with their son (despite <a href=#>questions about how much time Nick actually dedicates to his brood</a>).</p><p>As for their current relationship, she often posts about Nick on social media, where he calls her "my love", it has caused drama—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">particularly on the Selling Sunset set with Chelsea Lazkani</a>.</p><p>But on her social media, Bre locks down posts featuring Nick and clearly doesn't care about commenters' opinions on her relationship. Plus, she previously stated to Us that, "I have a beautiful relationship. We’re very open, we’re very honest, we’re very supportive. All of my needs are met, and I’m very happy in our situation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay2tbSMm6meZaSesrS1jJqlnWWapLWvuthmpJqmqp6yrXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shari-dyon-perry-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shari Dyon Perry Net Worth</span></a>
