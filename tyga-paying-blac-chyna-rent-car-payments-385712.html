The former couple has had their share of drama this year, as the <a href=#>rapper’s relationship with reality star Kylie Jenner</a> earned headlines and the vixen’s rumored tryst with Future has been the latest source of Internet chatter. In the latest piece of information regarding Tyga and Chyna’s arrangements, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> has reportedly obtained their custody order.</p><p>The site reports that the ex-couple’s agreement provides for the banning of smoking around their son. Though TMZ speculates that weed smoke is a factor in the provision, another piece of information points to Tyga picking up a few tabs for Blac Chyna as well, including her car payments, rent, and nanny expenses. Back in April, the model/business owner was reportedly seeking sole custody of King, but that has seemingly been swapped out for their current situation.</p><p>TMZ also reports that Tyga and Blac Chyna’s custody agreement prohibits the two from slandering each other on social media. This part of the deal has been upheld, for the most part. Both parents have taken subtle jabs (see <a href=#>here</a> and <a href=#>here</a>), but they have not engaged in any explicit war of words online.</p><p>Is this a winning deal, or nah?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6nGqK2MqZiyoZ6ceqO4wJxknKCpo65uvsSnq2abkad6sa3YppynrKNigHmBlmppaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-font-wife-is-he-married-to-girlfriend-kathryn-frias.html><span>←</span><span>Rob Font Wife: Is He Married To Girlfriend Kathryn Frias?</span></a>
