He has referred to her as a “bada–” in past interviews, or other fans have theorized it might mean “babe.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Either way, it’s so sweet to see these two still support each other after their split. The two struck up a romance back in 2011 after working on the film&nbsp;Wanderlust&nbsp;together. After months of anticipation, they finally tied the knot with a romantic backyard wedding ceremony in 2015 — sadly splitting just two years later in 2018. Justin and Jennifer were married for a total of three years before breaking up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Justin-Theroux-thanks-ex-Jennifer-Aniston-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I would say we’ve remained friends,” The Leftovers <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said to Esquire back in April 2021</a>. “We don’t talk every day, but we call each other. We FaceTime. We text…like it or not, we didn’t have that dramatic split, and we love each other,” he added. The mutual respect appears to be on both sides: back in August, the actress posted a birthday tribute for Justin, saying she “loves” him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Happy birthday JT</a>,” she wrote at the time, including a shirtless photo of Justin pointing pointing heavy metal hands at the camera. “Truly one of a kind. Love you,” she also said. Similarly, Justin <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>also sent love for Jen’s birthday</a> back in Feb. 2021. “Happy birthday @jenniferaniston. Love you B!” he gushed earlier this year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In his Esquire interview, Justin also addressed their close friendship post-marriage. “I’m sincere when I say that I cherish our friendship. It would be a loss if we weren’t in contact, for me personally. And I’d like to think the same for her,” he also said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49sZqOto6m2r3nToZyrp6WterW0wKeirGWamruvtcWeqWaZnp7AtbvNZqWim5ujrq6xjKWmpZmmnrJuvMeoq6hn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-brothers-red-utley-explains-why-he-didnt-trust-america-lopez.html><span>←</span><span>Big Brothers Red Utley Explains Why He Didnt Trust America Lopez</span></a>
