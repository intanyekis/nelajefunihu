Here are 20 times that Donna and Eric's relationship got gross, mean, or downright weird.</p><h2 id=eric-kisses-someone-else-then-tells-donna-the-other-girl-was-a-better-kisser-than-her><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Eric Kisses Someone Else, Then Tells Donna The Other Girl Was A Better Kisser Than Her</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/That-70s-Show-Kiss.jpg><p>By Season 1, Episode 9 of&nbsp;That '70s Show, Donna and Eric have already kissed and begun their romance. But then Eric's sister Laurie brings her friend Kate home for Thanksgiving. Kate and Eric make out, and when he tells Donna about it, he calls their make-out sesh "real kissing."&nbsp;Ouch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=donna-uses-eric-to-get-back-at-her-parents-during-their-messy-divorce><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Donna Uses Eric To Get Back At Her Parents During Their Messy Divorce</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bob-Pinciotti-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>In the first couple of seasons of&nbsp;That '70s Show, Donna's parents are trying and failing to make their crumbling marriage work. Whenever they get especially weird or dysfunctional, Donna acts out - and most of the time, this involves getting into trouble with Eric. Eric knows she uses him to get back at her parents and even jokes about it.</p><h2 id=eric-pantses-donna-in-front-of-all-their-male-friends-then-laughs-at-her-choice-of-underwear><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Eric Pantses Donna In Front Of All Their Male Friends, Then Laughs At Her Choice Of Underwear</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eric-Pantses-Donna-That-70s-Show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 3, Episode 15: "Donna's Panties." During a basketball game in the driveway with their friends, Eric pulls down Donna's pants when she goes for a slam dunk and then joins in with their friends when they laugh at her granny panties. It's meant as a harmless prank, but Donna is understandably furious. By Season 3, she isn't just "one of the guys" anymore - she's Eric's girlfriend.</p><h2 id=hyde-and-kelso-bully-eric-for-being-a-virgin><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Hyde And Kelso Bully Eric For Being A Virgin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hyde-and-Kelso-yell-at-Eric-on-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>Halfway through Season 2, Donna surprises Eric by climbing up to his bedroom window in the middle of the night and sleeping with him in his bed. They're both very happy with how the night went, until Hyde and Kelso hear about it and berate Eric for not trying to have sex with Donna. Naturally, the next time Donna climbs through his window, they don't have as good a time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-loves-cake><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Eric Loves...

When she does, it takes Eric completely by surprise, and instead of telling her he loves her too, he blurts out that he loves cake. Eric is never exactly a smooth operator, but this was definitely one of his weirder moves.</p><h2 id=donna-is-a-strident-feminist-yet-ignores-eric-s-misogyny><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Donna&nbsp;Is A Strident Feminist, Yet Ignores Eric's Misogyny</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Donna-and-Eric-on-That-70s-Show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donna is a woman slightly ahead of her time. She takes no guff from anyone, believes in women's equality, and always talks about the importance of women going to college and being able to support themselves. Eric is more in line with the times, still making sexist comments about his sister and female friends and expecting Donna to defer to him in their relationship. Why she puts up with it is anyone's guess.</p><h2 id=eric-tries-to-pressure-donna-into-committing-with-a-promise-ring-then-dumps-her-when-she-says-she-s-not-ready><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Eric Tries To Pressure Donna Into Committing With A Promise Ring, Then Dumps Her When She Says She's Not Ready</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eric-and-Donna-Ring-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>In Season 3, Eric and Kelso go shopping for promise rings for their girlfriends. Eric thinks Donna will be thrilled with the gift, but she's hesitant such a big commitment at such a young age. Eric feels slighted and makes her choose: him and the ring, or break up. She tearfully chooses to end the relationship.</p><h2 id=donna-is-constantly-getting-eric-into-trouble-with-school-his-parents-and-the-cops><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Donna Is&nbsp;Constantly Getting Eric Into Trouble With School, His Parents, And The Cops</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Donna-And-Eric-Arrested-That-70s-Show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the start of the series, Eric is a reasonably well-behaved kid who gets into the occasional bit of trouble. Once he starts dating Donna, he gets suspended from school for smoking (he wasn't smoking the cigarette - she&nbsp;was, to get her parents' attention) and in trouble with the cops on more than one occasion - once for throwing a kegger in an abandoned pool (awesome) and another time for having sex in his car.</p><h2 id=eric-is-shamelessly-attracted-to-donna-s-mom><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Eric Is Shamelessly Attracted To Donna's Mom</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Midge-Pinciotti.jpg><p>All of the boys on&nbsp;That '70s Show&nbsp;find Midge Pinciotti attractive.

The worst case is in Season 2, when Donna tells Jackie that her first time sleeping with Eric was a bit awkward. Jackie tells Kelso, and soon Eric is humiliated by all his friends for his performance.&nbsp;Yikes.</p><h2 id=eric-tries-to-kiss-his-own-cousin><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Eric Tries To Kiss His Own Cousin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Red-Foreman-That-70s-Show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 4, Episode 14 is a very weird episode of&nbsp;That '70s Show. In an attempt to get back at him for bullying her as children, Eric's cousin Penny tells him that she was adopted, seduces him, then makes the family think he tried to molest her. While Penny is clearly a screwed-up person to do what she did, there's no ignoring that, "adopted" or not, Eric was ready to make out&nbsp;with his cousin.</p><h2 id=donna-shamed-eric-in-a-story-she-knew-the-whole-school-would-read><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Donna&nbsp;Shamed Eric In A Story She Knew The Whole School Would Read</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eric-and-Donna-Report-Cards-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>Halfway through Season 4, Donna gets one of her short stories published in the school paper. She uses thinly-veiled versions of herself and Eric as characters, and tells the story of their relationship, painting Eric in worst possible light. The whole school sees right through it and Eric gets a lot of hate from the other girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-slut-shamed-donna-for-mooning-in-the-background-of-a-yearbook-photo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Eric Slut-Shamed Donna For Mooning In The Background Of A Yearbook Photo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/That-70s-Show-Gang.jpg><p>Donna, being a tomboy and a bit of a goof, decides to moon in a photo taken during a pep rally.

In Season 2, Eric is talking with his father while pulling his car into the garage and accidentally runs over Mr. Bonkers, Donna's childhood pet. It's clearly a tragic mishap. When she gets worried and starts looking for him, he's so afraid to tell her the truth that he lies and says he hasn't seen Mr. Bonkers. He lets her believe the cat ran away for so long that when he finally does fess up to the accident, she's understandably angry.</p><h2 id=they-constantly-get-jealous-of-each-other-s-new-flames><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Constantly Get Jealous Of Each Other's New Flames</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Donna-and-Casey-on-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>Maybe this is just to be expected when you hang out with your first love on a near-daily basis, but Donna and Eric are&nbsp;not&nbsp;very mature when it comes to seeing each other with anybody else.
