"I’ve definitely come across turmoil … being judged for really no reason at all, just based off associations."</p><h2 id=r-kelly-hasn-39-t-been-paying-his-child-support><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>R Kelly Hasn't Been Paying His Child Support</span></h2><p>With a negative net worth, it should come as little surprise that R Kelly hasn't been paying his child support bills.

The judge cautioned the singer that he could stave off further jail time as long as he kept up with monthly payments. It is uncertain whether his family actually received this money, however, as Kelly's attorney, Devereaux Cannick, has recently claimed in court that the star's "funds are depleted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-claims-he-can-39-t-pay-child-support-because-his-ex-wife-is-quot-destroying-quot-his-name><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Claims He Can't Pay Child Support Because His Ex-Wife Is "Destroying" His Name</span></h2><p>R Kelly's ex-wife, Drea, has been vocal in her condemnation of her former spouse, having featured prominently in the documentary exposé Surviving R Kelly.
