It features over 9,000 square feet of living space, which includes 5 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms. The mansion also comes with a detached guest house that has 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom.</p><p>The home’s other features include an indoor theatre, a pool, an outdoor kitchen, a fountain, a fire pit, a wine cellar, an outdoor shower, and access to a private beach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second lot is currently vacant but comes with over 6.6 acres of land, meaning plenty of space to built. The undeveloped land was <a href=#>selling for $28.2 million</a>. Altogether, their new estate boasts 10 acres of land, which includes a lake and vast lawns.</p><p>It's unclear what the couple plans to do with the new estate, but given their history of buying and renovating homes, that may be the plan. In fact, Ellen and Portia are known for buying and selling multiple homes a year.</p><p>In October 2021, Ellen and Portia made headlines for selling a <a href=#>Montecito property for $55 million</a>, only to buy two new properties shortly after. They originally bought the compound for $49 million in late 2020. It features three separate lots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Ellen said she started getting into house flipping after she started making money.</p><p>“The first thing I did when I made money was buy a house. And then…” she told <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a> in 2011. De Rossi added, “Another one, and another one, and another one, and another one.”</p><p>Just this year, Ellen and Portia listed a California home for $13.9 million, only four months after purchasing it. The couple reportedly did minor renovations, but nearly made $2 million in profits after the sale was complete.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone Is Selling Mega-Mansion Only 9 Months After Buying It</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>HOLA</a>, <a href=#>Just Jared</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaepJyau26wxKCcp52imsBusNGop6xlZ2V6rrXLpaCopl2ku26tzairoZ2iYrykscCnnaunnql6pr%2FTmqueZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-atsu.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Atsu Wiki 2023 - Girlfriend, Salary, Tattoo, Cars &amp;amp; Houses and Net Worth</span></a>
