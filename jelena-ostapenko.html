Her mother has continued to be her full-time coach and/or a key part of her coaching team throughout her playing career.</li><li>Around the age of 5, she had also started dancing and went on to participate&nbsp;in the National Latvian Championships for ballroom dancing. Jeļena began focusing solely on tennis around the time she turned 12. In an interview, she had credited her hand-eye coordination and skilled footwork in tennis to her years of dancing experience.</li><li>Representing a mixed-NOCs team (a team consisting of athletes representing different National Olympic Committees), she had won the ‘Bronze’ medal at the 2014 Nanjing&nbsp; Youth Olympic Games in the girls’ doubles format.</li><li>At the youth tier, she had reached a peak world ranking of number 2 in September 2014 and had clinched the 2014 junior Wimbledon Championships title in the girls’ singles event.</li><li>At the 2017 French Open, she had become the first Latvian female player to reach the semi-final stage of a Grand Slam tournament. She was also the first teenager to achieve this feat since <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ana Ivanovic</a> in 2007. Upon reaching the final of the tournament, she had become the&nbsp;first unseeded female player to play in the final of the French Open since 1983 and the first Latvian player to reach the final of a Grand Slam tournament.</li><li>Upon winning the final of that tournament, she became the first Latvian player to win a Grand Slam singles tournament and the first unseeded woman to win the French Open since 1933. She&nbsp;also became the first player since Gustavo Kuerten to win his or her first career title at a Grand Slam tournament. In a weird coincidence, Gustavo had achieved this feat at the 1997 French Open on the very day Jeļena was born.</li><li>With this win, she had reached a new career-high singles world ranking of 12. This historic triumph had won her the 2017 ‘WTA Tour Most Improved Player of the Year’ award as well as the 2017 ‘Latvian Sportswoman of the Year’ award.</li><li>At the 2017 Wuhan Open, she had scored her first win over a reigning WTA number one ranked player when she had defeated <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Garbiñe Muguruza</a> in the quarter-final of the tournament.</li><li>Between 2016 and 2019, Jeļena held the distinction of being the only player in recorded history to have won a Grand Slam title (the 2017 French Open) and lost in the first round of that competition the 3 other times she had been featured in its main draw (2016, 2018, and 2019). This run ended in 2020 when she had ended up in the 3rd round of the tournament.</li><li>At the 2021 Eastbourne International, she had become just the 3rd wildcard to win the title after Monica Seles in 1996 and Julie Halard-Decugis in 2000.</li><li>At the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics (played in July-August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), she was a flagbearer for Latvia alongside basketball player Agnis Čavars.</li><li>At the 2022 Dubai Championships, she had reached the final after defeating 4 Grand Slam champions in a row – <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Sofia Kenin</a> (1st round), <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Iga Świątek</a> (2nd round), <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Petra Kvitová</a> (quarter-final), and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Simona Halep</a> (semi-final). Winning the title had seen her return to the ‘Top 15’ of the official WTA singles rankings, at number 13.</li><li>Although her legal name is Jeļena, her family and friends call her Aļona. At the time of her birth, her parents wanted to name her Aļona but since the name was not on the Latvian name calendar, she was named Jeļena after her mother.</li><li>She had been known as Aļona by fans in Latvia and Eastern Europe forever but the name was unknown elsewhere until her fairytale triumph at the 2017 French Open. She uses her legal name professionally to avoid any administrative confusion.</li><li>A polyglot, she is fluent in Latvian, Russian, and English.</li><li>An animal lover, she owns a pet dog named Juljeta.</li><p>Featured Image by Jeļena Ostapenko / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqOcpZ2elnqwv9Oap56mm6R8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-brolin.html><span>←</span><span>James Brolin Net worth, Age: Kids, Weight, Wife, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
