He does not live in Byron Bay though-- he lives in Melbourne. Hugh Jackman played the character of Wolverine in X-Men films for years promoting his fans to believe he would own a home in Hollywood or New York City like many of his X-Men castmates but he prefers to live down under instead of in the spotlight.</p><h2 id=wiz-khalifa---pennsylvania-usa><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wiz Khalifa - Pennsylvania, USA</span></h2><p>Wiz Khalifa struck gold as a rapper in the hip hop industry after rising to fame and growing popular amongst rap music-lovers.

It might sound a bit random but the images of his home explain why. His home is very nice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tyler Cameron Shows Off His Gorgeous New York City Bachelor Pad</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZKWhppp6p63RZpiwmalis7O7zGajqKtdlruoscueqmamlax6urvRpGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-juliette-lewis-before-yellowjackets.html><span>←</span><span>Who Was Juliette Lewis Before 'Yellowjackets'?</span></a>
