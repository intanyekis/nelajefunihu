A hard act to follow, but Dolce & Gabbana are renowned for taking their shows to the next level every season, and today's might just have been their most spectacular to date.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>E! News</i></a>, On Sept. 23, she appeared on the runway with Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce during the finale of the event after they debuted a new spring-summer 2023 collection, a collaboration with the reality star. Kim wore a sleeveless gown covered in black Swarovski crystals in different dimensions to achieve a three dimensional texture, and her platinum blond hair styled in an updo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian took center stage at Dolce & Gabbana's Milan Fashion Week show because of her family supporting her from the front row.</p><p>Kim's eldest three children North West, 9, Saint West, 6, and Chicago West, 4, plus mom Kris Jenner and sister Khloe Kardashian cheered her on from the front row.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Kim Kardashian Donates Millions In Aid To Baby2Baby To Support Underserved Children During The Pandemic</b></a></span></p><p>For the SS23 collection, designed in collaboration with Kim Kardashian, models wore a series of largely black, white and silver looks featuring signature lace, crystal and leopard print embellishments – as a black and white blown-up video of Kim Kardashian eating spaghetti played in the background. The show opened to the dramatic sounds of paparazzi camera clicks, screams of 'We love you Kim!' and light flashes, while Kris Jenner, Khloé Kardashian and North West provided family support from the front row.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian herself didn't walk as part of the main show, but appeared after the finale from behind a screen in a glittering black gown, alongside designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. The three bowed together, elevating the star from celebrity attraction to full-blown designer status.</p><p>Kim Kardashian's fashion footprint was all over the collection, from distressed denim pieces, super-cinched corseted waists and body-con silhouettes, to stretch jersey materials, slouched coats and 'KIM' chokers adorning models' necks. Multiple veils and the largely black colour palette were an apt reflection of the feeling of mourning that has defined this fashion season, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, as per <a href=#><i>ELLE</i></a> reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Lights, camera, action. #CiaoKim</p><p>Watch the show live - Today at 2:30pm CEST</p><p>#DolceGabbana”</p><p>Dolce & Gabbana teased a collaboration with Kim Kardashian a few days before the show, revealing their latest advertising campaign entitled 'Ciao Kim' that features the star in full Italian glamour mode with peroxide blonde hair and a black lace dress surrounded by fawning paparazzi.</p><p>The black and white images mark the second time Kardashian has channeled Marilyn Monroe this year, following her Met Gala appearance in the late Hollywood starlet's iconic 'naked' gown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Post Malone Abruptly Postponed Saturday Show In Boston</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>ELLE</a>, <a href=#>E!
