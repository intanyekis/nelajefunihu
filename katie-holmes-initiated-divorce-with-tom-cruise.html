After Cruise caught wind of the interview, the actor contacted Holmes's manager and asked to meet with her.The meeting happened <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">under the pretense</a> that the creators of Mission: Impossible were considering Holmes for a role. Holmes said of first seeing Cruise, "I knew in an instant that we were going to be together, that we were going to get married."Things changed... let's take a look how the downwards spiral took place between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-were-married-in-italy>Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes Were Married In Italy</h2><p>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wedding was held at the Castello Orsini-Odescalchi in Bracciano, Italy in November 2006. Seven months later, their daughter Suri was born on April 18, 2006. The star-studded ceremony was held at Odescalchi Castle in Italy on November 18, 2006.</p><p>The nuptials were attended by some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including the likes of Victoria Beckham, Jennifer Lopez, John Travolta, and former Scientologist, Leah Remini. Tom and Katie were dubbed "TomKat" by the media and were known for their huge PDA sessions on the red carpet. Cruise famously jumped on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah Winfrey's couch</a> and declared his love for Holmes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-reportedly-did-not-want-their-daughter-suri-raised-in-tom-cruise-s-religion>Katie Holmes Reportedly Did Not Want Their Daughter Suri Raised In Tom Cruise's Religion</h2><p>Back in 2012, the Hollywood power couple shocked the world when they announced to the world they were getting a divorce after six years of marriage. According to Radar Online, Holmes had made a "secret divorce deal" with Cruise that allegedly forbid her from publicly commenting on their separation. Holmes was also allegedly banned from dating someone else for five years after their breakup. A decade has passed since their divorce, and the Pieces Of April actress has still remained quiet about the situation surrounding their divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to InStyle, Cruise revealed that he "didn't expect" his wife to file for divorce. Although neither party has confirmed why the highly publicized breakup actually took place, there are plenty of rumors surrounding Holmes' decision to end their marriage. One of the primary rumors was reported by HuffPost in 2013, when Cruise discussed Holmes' resistance to raising their daughter, Suri, in Tom's religion. Cruise and Holmes' divorce settlement sees Holmes having "sole custody" of Suri, and reportedly includes an "ironclad" ruling that Suri would not be exposed to anything of Tom's releigion related.</p><p>According to multiple sources, Suri Cruise does not see her father due to his strongly held beliefs. A practice in the religion called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"disconnection"</a> discourages members to associate with non-believers. In 2012, Cruise sued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a> and In Touch magazines for reporting that he had abandoned his daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Destroyed Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes' Relationship, According To Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-has-moved-on-and-is-dating-a-musician>Katie Holmes Has Moved On And Is Dating A Musician</h2><p>Meanwhile, Katie Holmes’ boyfriend, Bobby Wooten III, has been introduced to her 16-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise. “He is getting to know her family,” the insider told People Magazine of Wooten.
