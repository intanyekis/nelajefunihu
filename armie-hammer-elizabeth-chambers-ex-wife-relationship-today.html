Since then, not much has been reported about the actor or his relationship with <a href=#>his estranged wife Elizabeth Chambers</a>. The ex-couple filed for divorce months before the scandal broke out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Former Co-Stars Henry Cavill And Armie Hammer Close In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-was-armie-hammer-in-rehab-for>What Was Armie Hammer In Rehab For?</h2><p><a href=#>Hammer reportedly checked into rehab to seek treatment for "drugs, alcohol, and sex issues."</a> Chambers was supportive of his decision. "He has so much trauma that he cannot deal with stillness, face himself, or sit alone with his s---," said a source. They also addressed the claims that the actor is just some "privileged" brat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everyone looks at Armie thinking that he's had some sort of privileged life—and that must mean there were no problems in his youth and everything was peachy keen," said the insider. "But that's not necessarily the way things go. Just because you come from an upbringing where financial resources are plentiful doesn't mean life isn't without problems."</p><p>The source added that Hammer's rehabilitation was "a clear sign that he is taking back control [of] his life and knows that this [is] a step towards his overall well-being." In October 2021, a source told TMZ that <a href=#>the Call Me by Your Name star was "thriving" in the treatment facility</a>. He had also kept in contact with his loved ones through FaceTime. Despite not knowing how long he'd be there, he was reportedly "willing to do whatever it takes" to get better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to entering rehab, Hammer had strongly denied the disturbing allegations. "I'm not responding to these bulls--- claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic," he told Daily Mail. He also announced that he was pulling out of the film Shotgun Wedding starring Jennifer Lopez.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Armie Hammer Has A Twin</a></span></p><h2 id=how-39-s-armie-hammer-39-s-relationship-with-estranged-wife-elizabeth-chambers-now>How's Armie Hammer's Relationship With Estranged Wife Elizabeth Chambers Now?</h2><p>Hammer is reportedly dedicated to staying sober following his rehab stint. "Armie is very committed to his sobriety and has been super consistent with it," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told E! News</a>. "His main priority is staying sober and being there for his kids and Elizabeth." However, the insider clarified that Hammer and Chambers haven't reconciled. "They're not back together but they're co-parenting," they explained. "He's really just trying to be there for his kids. He has a solid support system with his friends and Elizabeth has also been very supportive along the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former couple filed for divorce in July 2020 after 10 years of marriage. "Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners, and then parents," they said in their statement. "It has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage." They added that their "children and relationship as co-parents" remain their number one priority. Nine months later, the accusations against Hammer broke out.</p><p>Chambers wrote on Instagram that she was "shocked, heartbroken, and devastated" about the news. She also expressed her "support [to] any victim of assault or abuse and urge anyone who has experienced this pain to seek the help she or he needs to heal." By August 2021, the Bird Bakery owner was said to be dating again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Armie Hammer's Family</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-armie-hammer-39-s-abuse-allegations>What Happened To Armie Hammer's Abuse Allegations?</h2><p>As of this writing, Hammer is still under police investigation over the allegations. However, <a href=#>that didn't stop his new movie Death on the Nile from becoming a box office hit</a>. His work on the film began in 2018 and ended in December 2019. Its initial 2019 release was postponed due to COVID. Disney had time to cut Hammer out of the movie the way Kevin Spacey was removed from Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World. But it just wasn't possible. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Indie Wire</a>, it still worked in the studio's favor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Director Kenneth] Branagh and Disney got (relatively) lucky here," wrote Kate Erbland. "Because the same reasons Hammer could likely not be cut (too many scenes, too complicated) are the same ones that allow him to kind of be forgotten." Despite the movie's luck and success, Hammer hasn't promoted the movie or landed any new projects. Death on the Nile could be his final film.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Much Is Actor, Armie Hammer Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6WZmnqprcymnKtllaG2u63BnquhZZOdrq6uxKuqZp2oYsSqssRmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaSksaLFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-to-know-jeanine-robel-anthony-edwardss-girlfriend-in-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Get to Know Jeanine Robel: Anthony Edwardss Girlfriend in 2023</span></a>
