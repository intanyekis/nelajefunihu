The pregnancy was not easy and we made it through,” the Wonder Woman actress, 38, captioned a hospital pic of herself snuggling her newborn daughter via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Wednesday, March 6. “You have brought so much light into our lives, living up to your name, Ori, which means ‘my light’ in Hebrew. Our hearts are full of gratitude.”</p><p>Gadot went on to welcome her daughter into her family’s “house of girls,” adding, “Daddy is pretty cool too 😉❤️.” Gadot and Varsano, 49, also share daughters Alma, 12, Maya, 6, and Daniella, 2.</p><p>Gadot’s baby news came as a surprise to fans as she had not publicly revealed her pregnancy. “Everyone knows that the only thing superior to Wonder Woman is Mother Woman 😇,” one Instagram user wrote in the post’s comments, while another stated, “Mazal tov!! I’m sure she’s beautiful like her mama!!”</p><p>The Israel native previously gushed about her role as a mother in a January 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>InStyle</a>, sharing, “I started young, I was 25 when I was pregnant with Alma. I always wanted to be a young mother. Yeah, three kids. No joke, woman. God bless them but it’s so much work.”</p><p>Gadot went on to note that she enjoyed labor so much she “would <a href=#>do it once a week</a> if could.” She explained: “It’s so magical. And I always take epidurals, to be fair, so it’s not so painful. Just the moment you feel like you’re creating life, it’s incredible. But the pregnancies are hard for me — I feel sick and have migraines. I’m not in my element.”</p><p>Varsano, for his part, praised how his wife manages to “keep a very balanced family life and work [life],” telling the outlet, “Everything is just smooth. That’s a very impressive thing, to juggle everything at the same time and stay normal.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gadot has offered glimpses into her family’s life via social media over the years. “We took a little family vacation before the next adventure 🌳☀️❤️,” she wrote alongside an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> slideshow of family photos in May 2022. “Just the five of us, some good food and a whole lot of nature. Now I’m more than ready to jump into a new exciting project.”</p><p>She shared more snaps of her kids in a June 2023 Father’s Day <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> tribute for Varsano, including a pic of the couple holding their youngest two daughters while on a hike and Varsano giving Alma a piggyback ride. “I’m lucky to have @jaronvarsano as the aba to my daughters. I couldn’t ask for a better role model, fun and funny dad for them,” she wrote at the time. “We love you baby, you’re our rock. Our compass and our heart ♥️.”</p><p>Gadot has several film projects in the works. She stars as the Evil Queen alongside <strong>Rachel Zegler</strong> in Disney’s upcoming live-action <a href=#>Snow White</a> and will portray Cleopatra in <a href=#>a film</a> about the Egyptian queen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagmZxitKKwzq1kmqaepMKvr8SsZJuhoqm1brvFZpmamqliu7B5k2auoqyYYrW2v8GapZ1lmpa%2FsLqMr5irq5GjvHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./critics-love-sex-lives-of-college-girls-what-do-fans-think.html><span>←</span><span>Critics Love 'The Sex Lives Of College Girls', But What Do Fans Think?</span></a>
