To say that this show is perfectly cast is a huge understatement, and the decision to cast Juliette Lewis as Natalie was simply brilliant</p><p>When speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> about the show, Lewis said, "I loved what the show is rooted in. You have these fiery, all distinct personalities who are great athletes as young girls, which even that I like because we don’t see that so often, and then you give them a plane crash and a survival problem, with which they do all kinds of wild things that they have guilt and trauma about. And then, we see them present day. My character is driven by wanting answers about something. You’re gonna slowly see all kinds of things from each character."</p><p>Lewis is thriving on the show, which has been great to see. The actress has been around the block in the entertainment industry, and she put in years worth of work before landing on Yellowjackets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Jonathan Bailey Before Becoming Lord Anthony Bridgerton?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-39-s-been-in-movies-like-39-what-39-s-eating-gilbert-grape-39>She's Been In Movies Like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'</h2><p>On the big screen, Juliette Lewis has been an active performer since the latter part of the 1980s.</p><p>Over the course of her career, the actress has been in movies like Christmas Vacation, Cape Fear, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Natural Born Killers, The Basketball Diaries, From Dusk till Dawn, The Other Sister, Old School, and a whole lot more.</p><p>To date, What's Eating Gilbert Grape remains one of her most popular movies. It starred Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, and while those two have received plenty of praise for the film, it simply would not have been as great without Lewis' exceptional performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Cape Fear, Lewis was nominated for an Oscar, and the 1991 film played a huge part in her career moving at lightspeed.</p><p>"It was all about natural teenage movement. Hunched shoulders, shyness. I based her on a girl I'd met in the park who wore bangs and always looked like she had a secret," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a> about how she prepared her Oscar-nominated performance.</p><p>In more recent years, the actress has done smaller movies. 2019's Ma is a recent standout of hers, and people would love to see her do more film work.</p><p>In the lead-up to her time on Yellowjackets, Juliette Lewis also did plenty of work on the small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Solomon Hughes And How Was He Cast As Kareem Abdul-Jabbar On 'Winning Time'?</a></span></p><h2 id=juliette-lewis-also-appeared-in-several-tv-gigs>Juliette Lewis Also Appeared In Several TV Gigs</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much like her work on the big screen, Juliette Lewis has been involved in television work since the 1980s. During that decade, she was featured on shows like I Married Dora and The Wonder Years, and aside from a couple of projects in the '90s, she would largely stay away from the small screen.</p><p>The 2000s would see the actress appear on shows like Dharma & Greg and My Name is Earl, but those were in supporting roles.</p><p>In 2015, she began her time as Detective Andrea Cornell on Secrets and Lies, and she was featured in every episode of the show. It was not a lasting hit, but it showed that Lewis was willing to star in television projects.</p><p>Once Secrets and Lies ended, Lewis would continue her television work before scoring a main role on Yellowjackets. The show has been a breath of fresh air, and it has already been renewed for a second season, much to the delight of fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Elizabeth Tulloch Before Becoming Lois Lane?</a></span></p><p>Juliette Lewis has had a truly remarkable career, and fans cannot wait to see what she is going to do on the next season of Yellowjackets when it finally hits Showtime in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Was Jacob Elordi Before 'Euphoria'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecmuo6KdpKmybrjEsKCsZZKas7C%2BxGawnqScpMSrrcKknK2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toya-bush-harris.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Married To Medicine's Star Toya Bush-Harris Is Married?
