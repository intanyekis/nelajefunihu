Brown has also toured the world with many of his shows selling out.</p><p>In comparison, Michael Jackson has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> sold more than 750 million records worldwide. MJ also won 13 Grammy Awards over the span of his career and was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Jackson 5 and as a solo artist) and received the American Music Awards’ Artist of the Century Award. The Guinness Book of World Records even cites the mogul as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time.</p><p>Ironically, in the same year that the King of Pop died, Chris Brown’s career took a turn for the worst. In 2009, the highly publicized incident between him and Rihanna sparked controversy and remained in the media for months. In effect, Chris’ third album <span id=ref1180199></span>Graffiti&nbsp;did not sell as well as his first two releases. However, two years later Chris redeemed himself with the album <span id=ref1180200></span>F.A.M.E., which became his first number one album on the Billboard 200 chart and even earned him his first major award.</p><p>Check out who else was mentioned as a potential “G.O.A.T” of this generation below. Is CB the regenerated King of Pop (or someone else)? VIBE will leave it up to you to decide.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hell nah, The Weeknd</p><p>— Xuxinho ?? ?? ??
