Yet, sources indicate that Britney's team deemed this gesture as a smart move, given that Sam's legal representative has hinted at a potential challenge to the prenuptial agreement, which could lead to an expensive divorce settlement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ notes that, per sources, the final amount could reach several hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>Insiders reveal that communication between Britney and Sam remains minimal.

"There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to [Sam] at this time.”</p><p>This statement has led certain individuals to speculate that he is probing into his entitlements and questioning their extent.</p><p>Sam has denied via his representative that he’s not challenging the prenup, but his divorce from Britney remains ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kroy Biermann Files To Divorce Kim Zolciak A Second Time Over Financial Problems</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHqtrdaynKurXZi8r8LIp5qeZZiav27AzmanmrFdm7yzedKapGaZo5y1or7IrGRqaGBlfW6vzqebqGWRoralecOiraiqk5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-mayim-bialik-do-for-work-before-big-bang-theory.html><span>←</span><span>After Taking A Break From Entertainment, Mayim Bialik Landed A Surprising Job</span></a>
