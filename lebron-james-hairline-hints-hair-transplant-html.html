However, his post sparked a plethora of tweets, considering in the movie’s teaser, James seems to have a wholly restored hairline. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Hairline Restored?</h2><p>James’s hairline has always been a topic of discussion for NBA fans, with many making fun of his receding hairline. But the teaser for&nbsp;Space Jam: A New Legacy&nbsp;had fueled the issue like never.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In James’s&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>, we can see the NBA superstar standing in front of a shocked Bugs Bunny.

While some were convinced that it was CGI hair, others thought he had gotten some sort of treatment or transplant. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jacques Abrahamian, a hair transplant specialist, gave his opinion,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suggesting</a>&nbsp;that James had likely undergone a hair restoration procedure. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Abrahamian guessed that the NBA superstar had used either FUSS (Follicular Unit Strip Surgery) or FUE (Follicular Unit Excision) along with SMP (Scalp Micro-pigmentation) to achieve the look seen in the teaser.</p><p>Chris Clarke from&nbsp;The Fumble&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pointed out</a>&nbsp;that James also had a restored hairline when he appeared in the 2015 movie Trainwreck. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Space Jam: A New Legacy</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the original&nbsp;Space Jam, Michael Jordan had to help Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes against the Nerdlucks in a basketball match with the Looney Tunes’ freedom at stake.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Space Jam: A New Legacy&nbsp;follows a similar <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">concept</a>, but this time, Bugs Bunny is enlisting LeBron James’s help to battle an evil AI.
