現在２６歳で平成生まれの現代っ子です。
音楽性的には他の若手とは一線を超えて、
独自に世界観を築いてるように見えます。
松尾レミさんの音楽のルーツを辿ると、
誰もが聴いたことのある洋楽・洋楽が中心ですが、
その入り込み方が異常に深かったようです。
長野出身の彼女ではありますが、
その実家の父親の影響も手伝ってか、
子供の頃からたくさんのインスピレーションをもらったそうです。
亀本寛貴さんは長野県飯田市、松尾レミさんはその隣にある豊丘村で生まれ育ちました。松尾さんの家族には、日本画家の祖父をはじめ、親戚にも画家が多くいたため、小さい頃から日本絵具を持って写生大会に出かけるなどしていたそうです。しかも、父親は大の音楽好き。家にはアナログレコードが大量に揃っており、常にロックが流れている環境でした。引用元：https://www.cinra.net/interview/otoheya/vol27-glimspanky
また絵などアート的な刺激も多く、
現在の松尾レミさんのファッションや、
想像力やボギャブラリーの深さを高めました。
また、青春期にはバンドを組んでいたそうですが、
主にどのような学生生活を送っていのでしょうか？
他の生徒たちと価値観が合うのか・・・笑。
松尾レミの出身中学・高校大学。実家の両親(父母) 松尾レミさんの生年月日は１９９１年１２月７日生まれです。
出身は長野県の豊丘村です。
実家の父は小さなお店を営んでるようですが、
それがいろんなレコードや音楽に触れるきっかけになったそうです。
実家でいろんな音楽やアートを物色できるなんて、
なんて羨ましい環境なのでしょうか・・。
出身高校は松川高等学校で、
ここで１年生の頃に初めてバンドを組んだそうです。
なんと、松川高校は軽音楽部がなく、
それでも文化祭のために演奏はするという、
なんとも言えない環境・・・。
音楽的には素人の集まりだったそうですが、
メンバーの入れ替わりの中で、
現在の相方である亀本さんが加入したのです。
松尾レミさんが高校２年生の頃には、
ソニー主催の「ロック番長」にて、
優勝という結果を出してます。
素人の集まりを引っ張ってこれはすごいですね。
（もちろん作詞作曲は松尾さんばかり）
そして高校３年生の頃には、
「閃光ライオット」というフェスに出演し、
日本全国から５５００組エントリーされた中から、
１４組のファイナリストに選ばれました。
田舎の高校生でありながらも、
かなり充実したバンドライフを送ってたみたいです、
これにはちょっとヤキモチ妬いちゃいますね・・・笑。
進学した大学は日本大学芸術学部で、
こちらは無事に卒業されたそうです。
バンドと勉強を両立しながらも、
日本大学に在学中は、
インディーズでミニアルバムなどを出してます。
大学卒業を控えた時期に、
メジャーデビューを決めているので、
松尾さんの学生生活はバラ色そのものだったことでしょう。
松尾レミに彼氏はいるのか？タバコは年齢的に・・(画像) 現在、バンド自体が大ヒットしている松尾レミさんですが、
私生活の方の充実はいかがなものなのでしょうか？
作詞作曲のライブ出演、
さらにはメディアにも多く登場してます。
忙しい時ほど彼氏が作れる言いますが、
松尾レミさん的にはどのようなタイプの男性を好みのでしょうか？
幼少期からの男子とのエピソードを聞いてる限り、
普通の女の子とは少し違う感じがしますね・・・笑
「よく男子とケンカしてたんですよ。とにかく負けず嫌いだったんで。鉄パイプ事件っていうのがあって……こんな個人的はこと話していいのかな？」
――お願いします（笑）。
「ケンカしてるとき、相手の男の子がサッカーのゴールのところで鉄パイプを拾って、それを振り回してきたんです。で、私も負けずに鉄パイプを持って振り回してたら、先生が集まってきて止められて。その後は職員室に呼ばれて正座ですよ、みんなが授業を受けてるときに。そういうことが何回もあったし、クラスで議題に上ったりもしてたんですよ。そのうち女子対男子みたいになって、“さん付けで呼ぶべき”“呼び捨てはダメ”みたいな討論をしたり。くだらないんですけど、そこでもめっちゃ負けず嫌いだったんですよね」引用元：http://www.cdjournal.com/main/special/glim_spanky_re_of_remi_matsuo/757/1</description></item><item><title>Glen Powell Bio (Wiki)</title><link>/glen-powell-biography.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/glen-powell-biography.html</guid><description>Who is&amp;nbsp;Glen Powell?Glen Powell: Age, Parents, Siblings, Family, Ethnicity, NationalityGlen Powell: Education, School/College UniversityGlen Powell: Professional Life, CareerGlen Powell: Awards and NominationGlen Powell: Net Worth, Salary, IncomeGlen Powell: Rumors, Controversy/SalaryBody Measurements:&amp;nbsp;Height, Weight, Body SizeSocial Media: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.Who is&amp;nbsp;Glen Powell?Glen Powell is an award-winning American actor, writer, and producer.He started his career with guest roles on TV and small roles in different films like The Dark Knight Rises and The Expendables 3 before making his breakthrough show the Fox comedy-horror series Scream Queens he played Chad Radwell.</description></item><item><title>Jacke Harry Is The Best Person To Watch Democratic Debates With</title><link>/jackee-harry-best-person-to-watch-the-democratic-presidential-debates-with-655658.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jackee-harry-best-person-to-watch-the-democratic-presidential-debates-with-655658.html</guid><description>If anything is certain, it’s Jackée Harry’s hilarious takes on the first night of the 2020 Democratic Presidental debates.
