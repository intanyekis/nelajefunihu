Cruise would later open up about the circumstances of the divorce in an interview with Talk magazine.</p><p>“I was dissatisfied, wanting something more,” he said. “It was just two people who weren't meant to work and it wasn't what I wanted for my life.

There was a freshness to life, and a mutual soul I was looking for. I just knew I couldn’t live without her.”</p><p>According to 'A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology,' a memoir written by former Scientology executive Mike Rinder, Cruise's ties with Scientology came in handy when he allegedly started contemplating leaving Rogers for Kidman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tom-cruise-is-loyal-to-his-team-but-he-didn-t-hesitate-to-fire-a-particular-stunt-coordinator.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Rinder, Scientology head David Miscavige saw the situation as "an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to make Tom's wishes come true" and “assigned” his trusted lieutenant Greg Wilhere "to get Mimi to agree to a divorce so Tom could marry Nicole."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/copy-of-untitled-66.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Russell Brand Called Out Tom Cruise During This Interview After He Was Rejected From Scientology</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Russell Brand wanted to join Tom Cruise's Scientology church but the action star didn't think he was the best fit for them.
