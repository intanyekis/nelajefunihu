It's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clearly a favorite among critics</a>, but fans seem to be a little more critical of the series. Let's find out what viewers think about the lives of Kimberly Finkle, Bela Malhotra, Leighton Murray and Whitney Chase. Let's take a look at what fans had to say about The Sex Lives Of College Girls.</p><h2 id=one-fan-felt-empty-after-she-binged-39-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>One Fan Felt Empty After She Binged 'Sex Lives Of College Girls'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This fan tweeted that she "felt empty" after finishing her binge session of Sex Lives Of College Girls. One fan responded and said, "ugh I've been thinking about that show recently." Another responded with "I might rewatch because I need some action in my life." Clearly, these fans are in love with the show and can't wait for the next season.</p><h2 id=one-fan-gives-39-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39-a-10-out-of-10><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>One Fan Gives 'Sex Lives Of College Girls' A 10 Out Of 10</span></h2><p>This fan tweeted that they thought Sex Lives Of College Girls was "so good" and that she finished all ten episodes of the series in one day. She also gave the series a 10 out of 10 rating and recommended it to her followers. One fan responded to her and said "SO SO GOOD!" while another responded with "I'm obsessed and I want more."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mindy Kaling Thanks Fans For 'Never Have I Ever' People's Choice Award</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-fan-wants-the-episode-order-doubled><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>One Fan Wants The Episode Order Doubled</span></h2><p>This fan tweeted and said that they want the number of episodes per season doubled if we only get four seasons total of the show, with each season being a year of college. One fan responded and said, "we need The Sex Lives Of College Girls: Grad School." Another fan responded and said, "I'm gonna lock the studio doors and no one's leaving til we get that 16 episode season."</p><h2 id=one-fan-cannot-get-enough-of-39-the-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>One Fan Cannot Get Enough Of 'The Sex Lives Of College Girls'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This fan tweeted "how many times can I watch The Sex Lives Of College Girls? The limit does not exist!" A few fans responded to the tweet with one declaring "me! It's my comfort watch right now!" It seems many fans on Twitter can't seem to get enough of the show, from binging it to re-watching it to hoping the next season comes sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id=one-fan-wants-a-39-never-have-i-ever-39-crossover-episode><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>One Fan Wants A 'Never Have I Ever' Crossover Episode</span></h2><p>This fan is not so secretly hoping for a crossover episode between The Sex Lives Of College Girls and Kaling's other comedy series, Never Have I Ever, which is set in high school in Los Angeles, California. Seeing as one series is on Netflix and the other is on HBOMax, it's highly unlikely to happen. Sorry to all the hopefuls out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Mindy Kaling Has Done Since 'The Office'</a></span></p><h2 id=one-fan-praised-mindy-kaling-39-s-work><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>One Fan Praised Mindy Kaling's Work</span></h2><p>One fan tweeted that they "will never be disappointed by a show involving Mindy Kaling.

He even said that he would settle for just a casting nod, even though he wants more. A fan responded and suggested that perhaps Kaling would get a writing nomination for the show. It's possible. Streaming shows do get a lot of award recognition these days.</p><h2 id=one-fan-adores-39-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>One Fan Adores 'Sex Lives Of College Girls'</span></h2><p>This fan claims to love Sex Lives Of College Girls for "the writing, the acting, the drama, [and] the beautiful storylines." The fan also admitted to being in love with the characters on the show, and clarified that they didn't just enjoy the show for the sex scenes.</p><h2 id=anne-hathaway-loves-39-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Anne Hathaway Loves 'Sex Lives Of College Girls'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anne Hathaway said in a recent interview with Jeff Conway that she was "wrecked for a week because I couldn't turn it off. The performances are so compelling and Mindy Kaling is just genius beyond genius." The actress worked with Kaling in the film Oceans 8. Hathaway joked that the show was great, but it wasn't good for her health to binge-watch the entire season all at once.</p><h2 id=one-fan-spent-national-women-39-s-day-watching-39-sex-lives-of-college-girls-39><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>One Fan Spent National Women's Day Watching 'Sex Lives Of College Girls'</span></h2><p>This fan tweeted and said "happy national women's day, I watched all of Sex Lives Of College Girls in under 24 hours." That's gotta be a record, right? As other fans have said on Twitter, it's an easy watch. The episodes fly by, and before you know it, you've finished the entire season!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Every Major Project 'The Office' Star Steve Carell Has Produced</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaq6GknrC0ecuorZ5lo5rFbrjIr5ysZZ%2BbeqS7y6WcoJ1dnLazuNJmrqGZpGKxsHnFmqWsZaSdtq%2B3jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./gal-gadot-announces-birth-of-baby-no-4-with-husband-jaron-varsano.html><span>Gal Gadot Announces Birth of Baby No. 4 With Husband Jaron Varsano</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
