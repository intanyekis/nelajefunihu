I was like, ‘I literally have no more fingernails left. I’ve chewed off all of my fingernails.’ … You cry, you laugh. It’s got adventure. It’s got romance,” the Set It Up star exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.&nbsp;“It’s just like one of those movies, where you’re like, ‘Oh, God, <a href=#>why can’t all movies be this fun and great</a>?’ It’s so rare.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Much like the OG cast, Maverick’s new faces made headlines<b>&nbsp;</b>after showing off their toned physiques&nbsp;in the film. According to<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>Teller’s trainer,<a href=#><strong> Jason Walsh</strong></a>, the Magnolia star made sure the men were prepared to show some skin — and their flying technique — on screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lewis-Pullman-Tom-Cruises-Top-Gun-Training-That-Beach-Scene-0003.jpg><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I knew Tom was gonna put these guys through it and he definitely did,” the Rise Nation founder exclusively told&nbsp;Us in June 2022.&nbsp;“You can see it on their faces.&nbsp;When they’re doing this, they’re not faking it. This is real.&nbsp;<span class=x_ContentPasted0>…</span>&nbsp;Tom <a href=#>is a huge advocate of making sure that these guys are really put through the rigors</a> and the tests … so [it was about] physical preparation, just getting strong, moving well, make sure physically [Miles] was very fit.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">That same month, Powell revealed that Cruise even had the group reshoot their now-famous beach football scene, which paid tribute to the much&nbsp;talked-about volleyball scene in the OG&nbsp;Top Gun, in which Cruise and his castmates played the sport in jeans and no shirts.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It was one of the first things we filmed. That was a great move, because you spend all this time getting into shape and it can be hard to maintain while you’re on set working these long shooting days,” Powell told <a href=#>Men’s Journal</a>. “The tough thing was that we didn’t realize the filming demands of the montage, which was a lot of camera angles and long lenses. So after we’d filmed for an entire day on the beach with Tom, playing our hardest and looking our best, we thought we were done and went out that night to celebrate — drinking and eating wings and tater tots. The next morning, we found out they were only getting Tom’s angles and would be shooting the rest of us the following week. We were like, ‘What?!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Powell recalled the cast running “back to to the gym” before the reshoot.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“We shot that whole thing about three or four times in total. It became the running joke — ‘Time to do the beach football scene again,’” he recalled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BkwKSt0axka2hiaHq1u89mnq6mXaKut7HRopqkZZiqu6y%2FjLCYpaNdp7KlecKaqamdpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-folk.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Folk</span></a>
