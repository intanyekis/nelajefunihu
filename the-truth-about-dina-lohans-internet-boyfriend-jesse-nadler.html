According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, the couple has been engaged twice.</p><p>In June 2020, Lohan said that they were getting married, as Nadler sent her an engagement ring. He explained to Us Weekly,&nbsp;“My plan is to fly home to Long Island, get down on one knee and propose. Soon after, set the wedding date in the Hamptons — my hometown. I just knew from the first call we had a bond and a calmness between us. From the beginning, we had this feeling between us that neither one of us could explain. It felt so real and right."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The problem? People aren't sure that Nadler is who he says he is. Because they haven't met each other, the word "catfish" has mentioned. Nev Schulman, the host of the long-running MTV reality series&nbsp;Catfish (and the documentary of the same name),&nbsp;said he would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">help find out the real Jesse Nadler</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People, Nadler said he doesn't wish to be known as a catfish. He said to&nbsp;Page Six,&nbsp;“I’m a good guy. I’m the real deal. Just the thought of people thinking I could be a catfish when everyone knows me and knows how hard I work and how I respect women and mothers, it just kills me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking Down Lindsay Lohan’s Short Prison Stint</a></span></p><p>Lindsay Lohan tweeted her support of her mom on&nbsp;Celebrity Big Brother but mentioned the word catfish as well: "But no more weird #catfish please," according to&nbsp;People.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;People, the reason why Nadler and Lohan have never actually met is that his mom isn't in good health.</p><p>Nadler has a job in commercial real estate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Hilary Duff And Lindsay Lohan’s 2004 Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=back-together>Back Together?</h2><p>According to&nbsp;Page Six, Nadler said that he isn't sure that the romance is going as well as it once was. He said, “She doesn’t want me to go, but I need her to live a healthy life,” Nadler told us. “It really comes down to that. I want a healthy, solid woman as a wife.” He continued, “I’ll set up ‘my house’ in Westhampton Beach. I wish I was setting up ‘home’ with Dina, but I don’t think it’s in the cards."</p><p>The couple broke up in April 2020 and then got back together. A source told&nbsp;People&nbsp;that Lohan thought that Nadler just wanted to be famous and that he wasn't interested in meeting IRL. The source said,&nbsp;“there was no meeting scheduled”&nbsp;and “Dina was already suspicious that he was media hungry and she is in talks about doing several new shows, including a dating show.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of where Lohan and Nadler currently stand, they have both had some struggles in the past. In April 2020, the pair reunited as they had stopped drinking. Nadler told&nbsp;Page Six,&nbsp; “[Dina’s] been sober and healthy for over two months, and we’ve been great. I don’t drink anymore."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan Looks Unrecognizable In Recent Post About Her Collab With ‘Lily Baker Jewels’</a></span></p><p>Nev Schulman told&nbsp;ET Online&nbsp;that the plan was to get Dina Lohan on an episode of&nbsp;Catfish&nbsp;but the stars didn't align.</p><p>Schulman said he might get the information out there somehow: he said, "there's a lot more to it than just Dina, and I think it's an important story that needs to be told. So I think I'm going to write an article or some sort of piece about that whole situation and hopefully, you'll see that soon."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What It’s Like To Work For Lindsay Lohan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6pbXNmmSlp5iWu7R5yKernqqemsFurs6ynauhlaOxbrbErKqeZZ6Wsa2x0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./model-train-forum-2.html><span>←</span><span>Model Train Forum List of Model Train Discussions and Forums</span></a>
