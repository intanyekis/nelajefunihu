Whatever the reason, the general public loves to see celebrities go insane, and it's not hard to see why.&nbsp;Much like regular people, celebrities are prone to things like mental breakdowns, or just getting too big for their own good following some success. The only difference is, their issues are brought to the world as cameras and reporters catch their every move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it can be sad, it's hard to deny that it's fascinating, even if it seems like a regular occurrence. So with that in mind, we found&nbsp;seven stars that publically went crazy.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>CELEBS THAT WENT CRAZY BEFORE OUR EYES</a></strong></p><h2 id=gary-bussey>Gary Bussey</h2><p><a href=#>Gary Busey</a> went loco because of his motorcycle accident in 1988 along with excessive use of cocaine, which he claims he used to sniff off his dog’s butt. He spouts quantum theories and metaphysical stuff at random. He is vastly entertaining to listen to, but it's sad to see how far he's fallen.</p><h2 id=kayne-west>Kayne West</h2><p><a href=#>Kanye West</a> makes the erratic behavior of others look normal. For instance, he took on the hacker group anonymous for claiming he sold his soul to the devil as part of initiation in the Illuminati.&nbsp;Another classic meltdown took place at the 2009 MTV music awards where he jumped on stage to interrupt <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> during her acceptance speech and said the award should go to Beyoncé instead. Even Beyoncé cringed when he did this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>WILL KANYE WEST'S WEALTH DECREASE DUE TO OUTBURSTS?</a></strong></p><h2 id=courtney-love>Courtney Love</h2><p><a href=#>Courtney Love</a> is such a wonderful example of what heavy drug use will do to a person. She has a love affair with drugs that included virtually all of them, such as cocaine, LSD, heroin, and other heavy stuff. The suicide of her lover, <a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a>, weighed heavily on her mind. She&nbsp;was taking heroin while pregnant with her child who was born addicted and needed an immediate detox. Thank goodness the child survived and is&nbsp;a young successful woman named Frances Bean. From exposing her breasts during the David Letterman show to having many public meltdowns,&nbsp;Love wins the award for the celebrity most out of control.</p><h2 id=charlie-sheen>Charlie Sheen</h2><p><a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> is the male equivalent of Courtney Love. His drug usage led him to throw his career down the toilet and marry one porn star after another. He is interesting now only because people wonder what&nbsp;he'll do next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>CHARLIE SHEEN SUED BY HIS UNCLE</a></strong></p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>Poor <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>. We actually feel sorry for her. She spun out of control and never had a chance to find her bearings again. &nbsp;Fame,&nbsp;money, and drugs made her literally lose her mind. It was only the legal troubles, and there were many, that forced her to try to clean up. So far, she is still on the edge of disaster. This is too bad because we like her.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS LINDSAY LOHAN RUMOURS</a></strong></p><h2 id=wesley-snipes>Wesley Snipes</h2><p>Imagine you are the film director of Blade III&nbsp;and your main actor, <a href=#>Wesley Snipes</a> stays in his trailer all day smoking pot and refuses to come out for any scene except for a close-up. He demanded that everyone on set call him "Blade." That is exactly what Snipes did, when he snapped and went out of control during the filing of this movie. After that, he went to jail for&nbsp;tax evasion. He is out now, and nobody has any further interest in hiring the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-richards>Michael Richards</h2><p>We loved <a href=#>Michael Richards</a> and his loony behavior in the Seinfeld television series as the character Kramer. However, after the television series stopped, nobody liked his racist tirade in response to a heckler when he was attempting to do stand-up comedy to continue his career. This was not funny at all and made him look exactly like the loser he has now become. His career is over and his one-hit wonder with&nbsp;Seinfeld is only a fond memory now.</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MOST SHOCKING CELEBRITY MELTDOWNS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3ynrcyorKxlo6mus7%2BMsJynrF2Yv6LG2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-howell-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Howell Net Worth</span></a>
