However, their marriage came to an abrupt end when Katie filed for divorce, and it was settled less than two weeks later. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Though many details of their divorce remained private</a>, it was reported that Katie was grated full custody of their daughter without a fight from Tom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To this day, may fans wonder why Katie was granted full custody. There’s speculation that it has to do with Tom’s religious beliefs; Katie may have not wanted Suri exposed to Scientology, so she agreed not to divulge details of their marriage in exchange for full custody, though nothing has been confirmed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Katie Holmes Was Staying In A Secret Apartment Before Her Divorce From Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>Nowadays, Suri reportedly has no contact with her famous father, and allegedly hasn’t seen him in years. And there’s reason to believe her relationship with her older half-siblings is the same. Tom adopted two children, daughter Isabella (born in 1992) and son Connor (born in 1995), during his marriage to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nicole Kidman</a>. Here’s what we know about Suri’s relationship with her older adult siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=suri-doesn-rsquo-t-see-her-dad-so-speculation-suggest-it-rsquo-s-likely-the-same-with-her-siblings>Suri Doesn’t See Her Dad, So Speculation Suggest It’s Likely The Same With Her Siblings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-tom-cruise-have-a-good-relationship-with-isabella-jane-s-husband-max-parker-despite-being-banned-from-their-wedding_-1.jpg><p>During Tom and Kate’s marriage, it was normal for the paparazzi to catch glimpses of the celebrities with their daughter. On a few occasions, Suri was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">photographed alongside her parents and older siblings, proving she’s met Isabella and Connor before</a>. However, there are no recent photos that show Suri spending time with her now-adult siblings in the last few years.</p><p>It’s unfortunately likely that Suri has little to no contact with Tom’s older children, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">since she apparently hasn’t even seen her father in years</a>. Isabella and Connor are very close to their father, even choosing to live with him after her divorced their mother, Nicole Kidman, in 2001.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Katie Holmes Initiate Her Divorce From Tom Cruise?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they’re now adults, they’re reportedly still close to Tom (their involvement in scientology is strong sign), so it’s hard to imagine they’d go behind his back to have a relationship with Suri, when Tom allegedly doesn’t have one.</p><h2 id=scientology-allegedly-played-a-part-in-tom-amp-katie-rsquo-s-divorce>Scientology Allegedly Played A Part In Tom & Katie’s Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/katie-and-tom.png><p>Neither Tom nor Katie have publicly discussed their divorce, so it’s unclear what led the former power couple to split. However, it’s long been speculated that Tom’s scientologist beliefs contributed to the break-up, and may explain why he doesn’t have a relationship with their daughter nowadays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katie was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reportedly studying Scientology during her marriage to Tom</a>, but became disenchanted with the religious group. She reportedly chose to divorce Tom to avoid getting more entrenched in the group. Nowadays, she’s lives full time in New York with Suri, who’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">attending a private Catholic school</a>. Being raised Catholic likely doesn’t sit well with her Scientologist father.</p><p>Over the years, sources have claimed Tom’s participation in Scientology is what keeps him apart from Suri, though it’s unclear if seeing his daughter would conflict with his religious beliefs, or if it’s more about the custody and divorce agreement between Tom and Katie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Is Tom Cruise The Richest Man Katie Holmes Has Been Romantically Linked To?</a></span></p><p>Speaking to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">one source said that Tom has legal visitation rights</a>, but chooses to use them to see Suri. “He chooses not to because she is not a Scientologist,” the insider said, adding he pays $30,000 per month in child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following year, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a different source told Hollywood Life</a> that Tom never wanted things to be this way and hopes to have a relationship with Suri in the future. “He still loves her,” they said. “Tom never intended to be estranged from his daughter when he decided to have a family with Katie and looks forward to repairing the relationship one day.”</p><h2 id=tom-rsquo-s-older-kids-are-devout-scientologists-while-suri-isn-rsquo-t>Tom’s Older Kids Are Devout Scientologists, While Suri Isn’t</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/untitled-design-5.jpg><p>If it’s true that Katie divorced Tom to get herself and their daughter away from Scientology, then it’s also likely that she doesn’t want Suri having a relationship with her older siblings, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">given their involvement with the church</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom’s older daughter, Isabella, isn’t just a practicing Scientologist, but also a high-ranking church member. In 2019, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">revealed in a promotional video for the church</a> that she’d undergone the training to be an auditor – a member of the church who questions and audits other Scientologists about their personal lives.</p><p>“It’s a few meltdowns and running to the bathroom to have a mini episode, but it is worth everything because you will get through,” she said. “This is a gift to yourself and so many others. It doesn’t matter if you aren’t going to be an auditor or aren’t going to join staff.”</p><p>Isabella encouraged other Scientologists to undergo the training she did, saying, If you are going to make it as a being for the long run you NEED this. That’s the truth… so stop messing around and get going.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, it appears that Suri doesn’t have a relationship with her older siblings. But it’s only a few more years until the teenager is a legal adult, and from then on, she’ll be able to make her own decisions about whether she pursues a relationship with her dad and half-siblings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYsC2vshmmqutmaiybrTAr5xmmV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uw8itn2asn6J6pL7UoqqeZZ6esLC4xGaiopydlru0ecqim6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./206785-boris-kodjoe-shares-comparison-photo-his-html.html><span>←</span><span>Boris Kodjoe's Wife Nicole Ari Parker and Daughter Sophie Look like Twins in a Photo</span></a>
