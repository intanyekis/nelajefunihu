This isn’t the first time he’s been<br>involved with the police, but this is the first time since 1990 he’s<br>being charged with possession of cocaine.</p><p>Burbank police Sgt. Kevin Grandalski<br>said the rapper/actor was also charged for having a false compartment<br>in a vehicle.&nbsp; The weapons charge alone is a felony.&nbsp; His lawyer, Donald Etra told the Associated Press that <strong>Snoop</strong>“was<br>in a car pulling out of the studio and was booked at jail for<br>investigation of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.”<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“As<br>of this point, he stands innocent of all charges, the goal tonight was<br>to get him out of jail.&nbsp; The goal tomorrow is to deal with the case,” Etra said.</p><p>The rapper is expected to be arraigned on January 11th, Etra<br>told the AP.</p><p>For a little rundown on <strong>Snoop</strong>‘s year so far.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>On<br>November 2, <strong>Snoop</strong> was charged with one felony count of knowingly<br>possessing a deadly weapon — a collapsible baton — while trying to<br>board a plane in Santa Ana, Orange County authorities said. A<br>spokeswoman for the performer denied the charges and said the baton was<br>“a prop” he inadvertently had included in his carry-on luggage.</p><p>On<br>October 26, <strong>Snoop</strong> was arrested at an airport in Burbank, and<br>booked for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and<br>transportation of a controlled substance. He posted $35,000 bail. His<br>publicist said the performer was scheduled to appear in court in<br>December.</p><p>On April 26, <strong>Snoop</strong> and several members of his<br>entourage were detained by police at London’s Heathrow Airport after a<br>skirmish that left seven police officers with minor injuries.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The seven police officers received minor injuries, including cuts and bruises, and one suffered a fractured hand.</p><p>While<br>in England for his 1994 “Doggystyle” tour, he was nearly kicked out of<br>the country after a Tory minister and British tabloids raised<br>objections to his presence while he faced murder charges in the United States. He later was cleared of those charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZka4R1e9Oiq6WdXqi7sLvPZp6erKNir7a%2F056bZpmXlrav</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-toews-girlfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Toews: Girlfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</span></a>
