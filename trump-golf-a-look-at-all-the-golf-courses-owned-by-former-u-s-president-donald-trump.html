Trump has been the headline for quite a few scandals and heavy criticism during his time in office. But as the world may know, Trump is recognize first as a business man before entering the realm of politics. His television show, The Apprentice, which began in 2004 and has also featured<a href=#> celebrities such as Martha Stewart </a>and Arnold Schwarzenegger, bolstered Trump's television personality immensely.</p><p>He is also known for his <a href=#>extensive real estate portfolio</a>, which has helped to build his net worth of $3 billion. Part of that includes the multiple golf courses he owns around the world. Here is a look at the most expensive golf courses owned by Donald Trump.</p><h2 id=trump-international-golf-links-scotland---150-million>Trump International Golf Links, Scotland - $150 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his presumed loyalty to America during and after his presidency, not forgetting the speculations surrounding him and the reigning Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't let that hinder his plans for international success. In 2006, he bought the 1,800-acre estate in Aberdeen, Scotland. The property may not have been graced with the presence of <a href=#>Hall of Fame and 82 PGA Tour-winning golfer, Tiger Woods</a>, but that doesn't mean Trump wouldn't want to emulate his sporting prowess. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Go Banking Rates</a>, Trump had a preference for Scotland over any other country because he is half-Scottish himself. He would spend $150 million on the construction of the estate which features a golf course, restaurant and 19 rooms in the renovated mansion on the property.</p><h2 id=trump-national-golf-club-los-angeles---264-million>Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles - $264 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Trump was most likely soaking up the attention with his radical tweets on Twitter during his presidential term in office, not all the attention he was receiving was positive, and it began to poke holes in his <a href=#>Golf Club business</a>. Boasting a 45,000 square-foot clubhouse, an 18-hole course, and a ballroom with a hosting capacity of up to 300 guests, the Trump National Golf Course in Los Angeles was purchased, remodeled, and re-opened in 2005 for a staggering cost of $264 million. When you think of Los Angeles, you think of Hollywood, which is in close proximity to the Trump National Golf Course. Being an actor and the star of NBC's The Apprentice, the estate attracted the likes of Michael Douglas, Mark Wahlberg, the <a href=#>dynamic actor Samuel L. Jackson</a>, and Caitlyn Jenner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Variety.</a></p><h2 id=trump-golf-links-at-ferry-point-new-york---127-million>Trump Golf Links At Ferry Point, New York - $127 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>True to his city-of-dreams, New York businessman identity, it would be uncharacteristic of Donald Trump not to have one of his golf course chains in the Big Apple. The Little Rascals star began building the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, New York on a landfill - an old garbage dump to be honest - in the Bronx that was closed in 1963. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Business Insider</a>, the course took 14 years to reach completion, and a price tag of $269 million to build. The 18-hole course was designed by <a href=#>legendary golfer, Jack Nicklaus</a>, and officially opened to the public in 2015.</p><h2 id=trump-turnberry-resort-scotland---43-7-million>Trump Turnberry Resort, Scotland - $43.7 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his presidency, Trump took up the mantle and went to war with "Fake News" and even two years after being replaced by President Joe Biden as President of the United States of America, the distaste of his actions, or lack thereof still lingers in the lives of those he has affected. Trump, who also owns a luxury golf course in <a href=#>the billionaire capital, Dubai</a>, purchased Turnberry from a Dubai government subsidiary named Leisurecorp for approximately $43.7 million in 2014. The Trump Turnberry Resort has hosted The Open PGA Tours Championship four times since the 1970s, but according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sky Sports,</a> R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers announced that The Open will not be returning to Trump's iconic Turnberry "in the foreseeable future" because it would be "detrimental to the PGA of America brand."</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The Richest Golfers, As Of 2022</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=trump-international-golf-links-ireland---12-9-million>Trump International Golf Links, Ireland - $12.9 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although his campaign slogan was "Make America Great Again," Trump doesn't readily apply the same patriotic stance when it comes to his <a href=#>international business endeavors</a>. The Trump International Golf Links, Ireland was previously named the Doonbeg Golf Club until it was placed on the market in 2014 and purchased by Trump for $12.9 million. Spanning more than 400 acres, the 18-hole golf course is one of Europe's most luxurious five-star destinations, even being ranked the #2 Resort in Europe by Condé Nast Traveler. It may not have attracted big names like former President Barack Obama and former pro-basketball player Ray Allen as did<a href=#> Michael Jordan's</a> exclusive golf course, The Grove XXIII, but it would be appreciated by golf enthusiasts.</p><h2 id=trump-national-doral-golf-club-miami---150-million>Trump National Doral Golf Club, Miami - $150 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of capitalizing on easy steals in the world of real estate, the apple didn't fall too far from the tree for <a href=#>Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump</a>. The business-savvy young lady worked out a deal to buy the property in 2012 after the Doral Golf Club filed for bankruptcy in 2011. She went on to purchase the spread of Miami property for $150 million. The estate features four different courses, the most popular of which is the Blue Monster. The golf course isn't the only thing owned by Trump in Miami. His other properties include the Mar-a-lago Club mansion, which is valued at $150 million and has played the<a href=#> host to Michael Jackson</a>, Celine Dione, and Oprah.</p><h2 id=trump-international-golf-club-west-palm-beach---5-million>Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach - $5 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Real estate in the Miami region can be seen as the new goal rush for investors who know better. It's America's own slice of the Caribbean islands right among the 50 states. <a href=#>Numerous celebrities make Miami their home away from home</a>, and even Will Smith has a song named Miami describing its carefree lifestyle. Therefore, it would make sense that you would find the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in the sunny Florida state. Sources state that Trump bought the private golf club from the Ritz-Carlton in 2012 for $5 million.</p><h2 id=trump-national-golf-club-westchester---60-million>Trump National Golf Club, Westchester - $60 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back over to the east side in Manhattan, New York, the Trump National Golf Club, Westchester is ranked among one of the elite courses in the Westchester area. Spanning over 7,291 yards, it is conveniently located 30 minutes away from Manhattan. Being a private golf club, the membership fee starts at $250,000, a price that would attract only high-profile personalities, such as former President Bill Clinton who is one of the club's VIP members. Trump opened the club in 2002 and reportedly spent $60 million on it. One of its most outstanding features is the 101-foot waterfall that on its own racked up a price of $7 million. However, a few years ago, Trump's Westchester Golf Club was under fire for rejecting <a href=#>former President Barack Obama's</a> to tee off on the estate because he refused to shut down the golf club and send his high-paying patrons away to accommodate President Obama. For Trump, it's money over everything and everyone!</p><h2 id=trump-national-golf-club-washington-d-c---13-million>Trump National Golf Club, Washington D.C - $13 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before he knew his headquarters would be in Washington D.C. as the 45th President of the United States of America, Trump went ahead to purchase the golf club that was formerly the Lowes Island Club for $13 million in 2009, which he renamed the Trump National Golf Club, Washington D.C. Trump reportedly seized the opportunity to buy the property after realizing that the former owner defaulted on its loans. The 18-hole championship course has held events such as the Junior PGA Championships in 2013 and, more recently, the 2017 PGA Championships, where the <a href=#>German golfer, Bernhard Langer,</a> became the first ever to win all five senior majors with his victory.</p><p><span class=next-single><strong>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Inside The Recently Sold $79 Million James Bond Golf Course</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky Sports</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Banking Rates</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmatqqWivW6zzqWdZpldobywt4yaq2aZnKF6tbTEZp6opJZisLDB0aycrGWfrLumsIybsGaen6e6pr6MrmSsZaCnsrS1w56lrWWUpLuiuMNmq6utnaV8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./that-70s-show-tv-show-problems-with-donna-and-eric-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>20 Things About Donna And Eric's Relationship Fans Ignore</span></a>
