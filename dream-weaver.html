Crowbar Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴I've just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behindOoh dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh dream weaver I believe we can reach the morning light
Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy"><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The lyrics are written from a first-person perspective, with the singer describing how they have closed their eyes and entered the "dream weaver train." The dream weaver is a metaphorical figure who can take away the singer's worries and leave tomorrow behind. The song emphasizes the importance of imagination and escapism, suggesting that dreams can help us to forget the pain of the present and look forward to a brighter future.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song repeats the phrase "ooh dream weaver," emphasizing the singer's belief in the power of dreams. They believe that the dream weaver can help them to "reach the morning light" and escape to an "astral plane" where they can forget their troubles. The song also mentions the possibility of flying to the "bright side of the moon," which could be interpreted as a reference to the famous Pink Floyd album.</p><br><p>Overall, Dream weaver is a powerful anthem about the importance of dreaming and escaping from reality. The song celebrates the power of the human imagination and suggests that dreams can provide us with a much-needed respite from the challenges of everyday life.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I've just closed my eyes again</u><br>The singer has shut their eyes to begin to imagine a different reality</p><br><p><u>Climbed aboard the dream weaver train</u><br>The singer has begun to fantasize and journey through their dreams</p><br><p><u>Driver take away my worries of today</u><br>The singer wants to escape their current troubles and experience something new</p><br><p><u>And leave tomorrow behind</u><br>The artist wants to live in the present and not worry about their future</p><br><p><u>Ooh dream weaver</u><br>The artist acknowledges and pleads with the dream weaver</p><br><p><u>I believe you can get me through the night</u><br>The singer trusts the dream weaver to guide them through their dreams</p><br><p><u>I believe we can reach the morning light</u><br>The singer hopes to experience a better tomorrow</p><br><p><u>Fly me high through the starry skies</u><br>The artist wishes to be taken on an imaginative journey</p><br><p><u>Maybe to an astral plane</u><br>The artist seeks to enter a mystical plane of being</p><br><p><u>Cross the highways of fantasy</u><br>The artist seeks to venture through their imagination and fantasy</p><br><p><u>Help me to forget today's pain</u><br>The singer seeks temporary relief from their current struggles</p><br><p><u>Though the dawn may be coming soon</u><br>The artist realizes that morning and reality are approaching</p><br><p><u>There still may be some time</u><br>The singer hopes to stay in their dreams a little longer before facing their reality</p><br><p><u>Fly me away to the bright side of the moon</u><br>The singer wishes to be taken on an even more fantastical journey</p><br><p><u>And meet me on the other side</u><br>The singer wants to meet the dream weaver on the other side of their journey</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: Gary Wright</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHuipMSjrdFoe6udkaKsmLHAr5yr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./curtsied-fashion-kim-kardashian-and-more-stars-sideline-style.html><span>←</span><span>Courtside Fashion: Kim Kardashian and More Stars' Sideline Style</span></a>
