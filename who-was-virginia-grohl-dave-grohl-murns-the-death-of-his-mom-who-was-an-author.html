He also views it as a great blessing to have a mother who is so supportive.</p><p>Grohl has worked on music projects besides his primary bands. He performed drums on Buzz Osborne’s solo-EP King Buzzo in 1992 while using the alias Dale Nixon, which Greg Ginn used to play bass on Black Flag’s My War.</p><p>Additionally, he released the music cassette Pocketwatch on the now-defunct independent label Simple Machines using the alias Late!

His parents separated when he was seven, and his mother reared him. At the age of 12, he started guitar lessons. After getting sick of classes, he decided to teach himself, eventually joining bands with pals.</p><p>When Grohl was 13 years old, he and his sister spent the summer at their Illinois cousin Tracey’s home in Evanston.
