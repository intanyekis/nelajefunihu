McMahon, who was a successful boxing promoter, began working with Tex Rickard in 1926.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-wwe-get-popular></span>When did WWE get popular?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>WWE in <b>the 1980s</b>. Wrestling boomed in the 80s and catapulted into the mainstream like never before. Wrestling was a known commodity in the 70s, but the 80s brought in a new era—the Golden Age. The introduction of cable TV and Pay-Per-View brought wrestling to the masses, and they ate it up.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-cant-they-say-wwf></span>Why can’t they say WWF?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The court ruling prevents the World Wrestling Federation from the use of the logo it adopted in 1998 and the letters WWF in specified circumstances. … The Fund has indicated that <b>it does not want to have any association with the World Wrestling Federation</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-wwe-fake-blood></span>Is WWE fake blood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In most cases, <b>any blood coming from the wrestlers is unintentional</b>. To maintain their TV-PG rating, when a wrestler bleeds on live television, WWE tends to attempt to stop the bleeding mid-match or use different camera angles to avoid showing excessive blood.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-era-are-there-in-wwe></span>How many era are there in WWE?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Considering that the company acknowledges conceptualizing their creativity over a period of <b>seven eras</b>, it is also equally responsible to understand how many superstars ruled them.
