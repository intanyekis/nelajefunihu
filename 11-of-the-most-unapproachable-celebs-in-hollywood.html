It's completely normal to do so, since these people have already succeeded at the goals we often hope to achieve, whether it's money, status, fame, or just simply having the dream job. In the limelight, they appear like sweet, genuine, hard-working individuals who seem to have it all. That is, until you realize that not everything is what it&nbsp;appears to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some say, it's best not to meet your heroes. And that may be very true. No matter how much we admire a celebrity, we often forget that they are just normal people but with more pressure living in a constant spotlight. We don't know what it's like to a well-known actor, a singer, or even a film director. And often those jobs are quite difficult. That being said, there are some celebrities who take their work or themselves so seriously it pushes everyone in the cast and crew away. There are even some who simply don't care about how they come across&nbsp;to others. We might never&nbsp;know the real reason behind such behavior (granted famous people are humans too so maybe those celebs are just jerks) but it's possible it could be because of status or longevity in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are plenty of Hollywood celebrities who feel that they are better than others or are just plain difficult to work with. So here is our list of 11 Hollywood celebrities who are known as the most unapproachable, on or off set.&nbsp;Happy reading folks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=11-megan-fox><strong>11. Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>Transformers star <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> has been called a diva and was accused of having a catty attitude on and off the set of <a href=#>Michael Bay’s</a> film. The director reportedly fired her over her less than favorable and disrespectful comments. Fox publicly stated on what it was like working with the director saying, “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets and he is. So he's a nightmare to work for but when you get him away from set, and he's not in director mode, I kind of really enjoy his personality because he's so awkward. He has no social skills at all.”</p><p>Obviously, those remarks didn't sit well with Bay or with <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>, who was the executive producer on the films. It was under his advice that Bay terminate Fox. Take note guys: don't bad mouth directors, especially if that director is working for an even more famous director.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-rihanna><strong>10. Rihanna</strong></h2><p>You probably weren't expecting this one (neither was I) but the singer/actress was publicly called rude at one point by a British TV host, Eamonn Holmes. According to The Sun, he was introducing himself to<a href=#> Rihanna</a> and things went downhill from there. Holmes simply said “ Hello [...] my name is Eamonn, I will be doing the interview with you.” Then the universe intervened in the form of one of the star’s large (and probably scary) bodyguards. “And this guy, he banged me on the shoulder and said 'Excuse me, if you want to speak to Miss Rihanna you speak to me.'" Yikes! The host did apologize but the event left him a bit shaken.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-lea-michele><strong>9.&nbsp;Lea Michele</strong></h2><p>The Broadway and Glee star, though she seems to have a sweet exterior, has often been called a diva on numerous occasions by various stars who have worked with her and fans who met her. One of them was <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, who played a dance teacher of <a href=#>Michele’s</a> character on the Fox musical series. In Us Weekly, a source close to Hudson said that the actress was “a total diva” on set. During Hudson’s short run on the show, she claimed that “Lea is a nightmare. Once, during a technical delay, Lea snapped her fingers and said ‘Let's go. I have plans!’” It was also reported that the two actresses kept their distance off set, too.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-jennifer-aniston><strong>8. Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p>You'd think former Friends star <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> would be the last person on Earth to ever be considered unapproachable or difficult. Maybe that is true, but in 2013 it was revealed in Radar Online, that her behavior on a movie set was very off. Rumors spread that she didn't socialize with any of her costars and often stayed in her trailer. A source said, “everyday at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together [...] but the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is Jen.” It's said that she would just grab her food and leave. It's possible she was just having an off day (or weeks) but that kind of attitude would push people away for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-january-jones><strong>7. January Jones</strong></h2><p>In 2011, according to Marie Claire U.K, Madmen’s Jared Gilmor, who played the son of <a href=#>Jones’</a> character Betty Francis on the AMC show said, “she's not approachable as the others. She's really serious about what she does. Everyone else is so nice.” However, her character is supposed to be intimidating. In Jones’ defense, her co star <a href=#>John Slattery </a>remarked "Betty Draper is an intimidating woman I suppose, if you were a 7-year-old boy [or] her son.”</p><p>While this may be the case, it appears that her attitude rubs Hollywood players the wrong way. <a href=#>Zach Galifianakis</a>, star of The Hangover, had a rough encounter with Jones one night. After some brief talk, she told him to leave. Before he did, he only had this to tell her “ [...] everybody's going to forget about you in a few years, so be f-ing nice.” Touché.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-bruce-willis><strong>6. Bruce Willis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> has always been known as one of the most difficult actors to work with in Hollywood. If there's anyone who knows how Bruce Willis really is, it's<a href=#> Kevin Smith</a>. In the Daily Mail UK, Willis was deemed as “soul crushing” by the Clerks&nbsp;director, while working on the comedy-action flick Cop Out. In an interview on the WTF With Mark Maron&nbsp;podcast, Smith told Maron that Willis was very difficult to work with as he refused to take pictures with the cast to help promote the film. His behavior was so rude that it played a part in causing the film to have weak box office sales.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-chevy-chase><strong>5.&nbsp;Chevy Chase</strong></h2><p>Comedian and actor <a href=#>Chevy Chase</a> is no stranger to onset controversy. Costars from various projects have said his behavior is downright difficult and often reckless. He was banned from Saturday Night Live after he verbally abused cast members. He hit<a href=#> Cheri Oteri</a> during a rehearsal in 1997. This upset&nbsp;other SNL Alum like <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a>, who then complained to the show’s creator <a href=#>Lorne Michaels</a>. Today, Chase remains the only SNL&nbsp;cast member banned from the show. More recently, he spewed racial slurs while working on the set of Community, even getting into public disputes with series creator&nbsp;Dan Harmon. This eventually led to Chase’s departure from the cult TV&nbsp;series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-kristen-stewart><strong>4.&nbsp;Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>Twilight star <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> is notorious for at least “looking” unapproachable because of her dislike for stupid and shallow interview questions or just about anything that isn't genuine. Not to mention she doesn't usually smile in photos much and suffers from the occasional "RBF" (resting b**ch face).</p><p>Regardless, this woman is full of life and fire. Stewart has stated that the perception she gets is annoying. In Vanity Fair, she said “When I hear that people are intimidated or they think I'm... unapproachable or something - I hate it.” All in all, she tries to be open saying, “Really what I'm dying to do as an actor, and as a person all the time is to reveal myself.”</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-gwyneth-paltrow><strong>3.&nbsp;Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p>Some people find Iron Man actress <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> unapproachable for many reasons, such as her pursuit of &nbsp;healthy living or her strong work ethic. Both of which are good, don't get us wrong. However, on the set of Iron Man 2, it was rumored that she displayed a cold and competitive nature. A source said, “Gwyneth is not friendly to anyone, and tends to make people feel awkward and uncomfortable.”</p><p>Paltrow seemed to have thrown some shade to costar <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>. “She wasn't outright rude to Scarlett, she just didn't ever speak to her," a source said. The source continued. “Gwyneth went out of her way to avoid Scarlett.” It's actually very common for Paltrow to act differently towards others if she smells competition.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-katherine-heigl><strong>2. Katherine Heigl</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Katherine Heigl</a>, star of Knocked up and Grey's Anatomy, has a huge reputation for being one of the most difficult stars in Hollywood. Though there isn't much talk about her these days, years back she often showed off her “tell it like it is” personality. While this may have earned some brownie points, her brutal honesty landed her in hot water numerous times, often at the expense of her successful acting career. Heigl had public disputes, most famously with her former boss <a href=#>Shonda Rhimes</a>. During her run on Grey's, Heigl refused to accept an Emmy nomination for her role on the show. She eventually became too much to handle as she failed to show up promptly for work, forcing Rhimes to let her go. Since leaving Grey's, Heigl has said she regrets her choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-kanye-west><strong>1.&nbsp;Kanye West</strong></h2><p>Oh, <a href=#>Kanye West</a>! While he may be a talented rapper, his random rants and sudden outbursts (no matter how comical they can be at times) count him as one of Hollywood's most unapproachable celebrities ever. His attitude comes off as abrasive and heavily self- involved in his outbursts, making anyone uncomfortable who reads or hears them. For example, he made a cameo appearance in Anchorman 2. The film’s star, Will Ferrell, found the whole experience “surreal.” Ferrell commented, “He was playing the new tracks a lot - over and over. Even when you're trying to film he's playing the tracks.” It got so annoying, they even got a nervous intern to get West to tone it down. The plan didn't work. West continued to play his music during filming, even supposedly starting a fight or two with other people on set... all because he's Kanye West.</p><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>dailymail</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>people</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaV2ks27Ax55kpqejqXq2usCpp6unkZi1oq7LnmScnZyar7R5yKdkoaecoca4u86dZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-cartisano-kids-son-jack-sparlin-and-daughter-olivia-sparlin-wikipedia-and-age.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Cartisano Kids: Son Jack Sparlin And Daughter Olivia Sparlin Wikipedia And Age</span></a>
