The new season will be set in 2019 and revolve around Juno’s Dot Lyon. The official synopsis reads:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“After an unexpected series of events lands Dorothy ‘Dot’ Lyon in hot water with the authorities, this seemingly typical Midwestern housewife is suddenly plunged back into a life she thought she had left behind. North Dakota Sheriff Roy Tillman has been searching for Dot for a long time. A rancher, preacher, and constitutional lawman, Roy believes that he is the law and therefore is above the law. At his side is his loyal but feckless son, Gator, who is desperate to prove himself to his larger-than-life father. Too bad he’s hopeless. So, when it comes to hunting Dot, Roy enlists Ole Munch, a shadowy drifter of mysterious origin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fargo-season-5-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>With her deepest secrets beginning to unravel, Dot attempts to shield her family from her past, but her doting, well-meaning husband Wayne keeps running to his mother, Lorraine Lyon, for help. CEO of the largest Debt Collection Agency in the country, the ‘Queen of Debt’ is unimpressed with her son’s choice in a wife and spares no opportunity to voice her disapproval. However, when Dot’s unusual behavior catches the attention of Minnesota Police Deputy Indira Olmstead and North Dakota Deputy Witt Farr, Lorraine appoints her in-house counsel and primary advisor, Danish Graves to aid her daughter-in-law. After all, family is family. But Dot has an uncanny knack for survival. And with her back to the wall, she’s about to show why one should never provoke a mother Lyon.”</p><h2>Will There Be A Fargo Season 6?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>There’s no word yet whether or not FX will renew Fargo for a sixth season. The anthology series is one of the network’s most critically-acclaimed shows. If Fargo season 5 performs well and showrunner/writer/director<strong> Noah Hawley</strong> is game for it, then season 6 is a likely possibility.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Noah has been open in the past about taking his time with Fargo. He doesn’t necessarily have a set game plan for the longevity of the series. “If an idea comes, we will do another one,” Noah said at ATX in 2017, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “I am certainly aware of the danger of overstaying your welcome or repeating yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8WaqaCnXaiyor%2FOp2RuZWVmgnKBk3Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./252317-jeff-hardy-a-james-storm-attending-country-music-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Hardy &amp;amp; James Storm Attending Country Music Awards</span></a>
