During the interview, Paul claimed that he bit his tongue for “the longest time” as people on Mayweather’s team kept assuring him that the money was coming. <a href=#>The money never came</a>,&nbsp;which Paul says left him feeling “offended” and “lied to.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>From Conor McGregor To Logan Paul: Floyd Mayweather's High-Earning Spectacle Matches</a></span></p><p>“You tell me, man. I’ve not been paid in full, that is a fact. There also have been alleged under the table cash deals that I was excluded from even though my name and likeness was used to sell our fight. He’s in for multiple lawsuits for this fight already,” Paul claimed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“We’re just trying to collect what’s rightfully ours.”</a></p><p>Mayweather defended himself against the accusations, saying that “back end” money from these events takes time to collect and&nbsp;that it&nbsp;“comes with the territory." The boxer&nbsp;claimed that he is still collecting on fights from seven or eight years ago. The back end is the cash from the pay-per-view buys, which Paul claims were over 1.2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul didn’t seem to buy his excuse and responded bluntly: “It sucks that he came out recently and said something like, ‘This is the name of the game. This is how it works in boxing,’ but I don’t know if it is."</p><p>Mayweather has been urged to pay Paul by&nbsp;Chael Sonnen of UFC fame,&nbsp;who suggested the boxer get&nbsp;ahold of Paul's people and pay up "before the FBI gets called in to look at the issue.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Golden Boy Promotions Owner Oscar De La Hoya Planning Mega-Fight With Floyd Mayweather In 2022</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sLPAp2SpmaWherSt2KxkraCRqcBuudhmmqGdk6B6orLTnqlmq5Watq%2BzjJ%2BjqLGUYrqixdaemK2glafAbrPOpZtmm5iWtq%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lashawn-daniels-dead-at-41-662806.html><span>←</span><span>LaShawn Daniels, Grammy Award-Winning Songwriter, Dead At 41</span></a>
