"A whole part of this conversation that Billie's not talking about is how Taylor has completely resurrected a dead industry. You can’t be the best at everything: you can’t be the most sustainable and be resurrecting industries and be a titan of industry."</p><p>Something else they criticized was the 22-year-old singer wearing the "Artists for Ceasefire" pin, saying she shouldn't get involved in politics. "<strong>This girl is so dreadful and she’s always been dreadful</strong>," said Jackie. "But now she’s sticking her nose in some things where it doesn’t belong.

"It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and <strong>I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable — and then it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the biggest artists in the world making f**king 40 different vinyl packages</a> that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Following the backlash from people who thought this was an attack on Taylor Swift, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish posted a statement clarifying what she meant</a>.
