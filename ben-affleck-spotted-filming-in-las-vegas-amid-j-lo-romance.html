According to a source, there “wasn’t any overlap” in Lopez’s relationships.</p><p>“Jen got back in touch with Ben after it became apparent to her that things with Alex weren’t working anymore,” the insider explained, <a href=#>describing the “flirty phone calls and texts”</a> that brought the Gigli costars back together. “Jen was very intent on parting ways amicably with Alex and being respectful to him.”</p><p>Lopez was previously engaged to the Gone Girl star from 2002 to 2004. “As soon as [they] started talking again, it became very clear to both of them that the <a href=#>old magic and special connection</a> was still there,” the source added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ben-Affleck-Filming-New-Project-in-Las-Vegas-Special-Visit-From-JLo-Mom-Main.jpg><p>Though they didn’t find their happily ever after in the early aughts, members of their inner circles are convinced this time will be different.</p><p>“They love being together and the weekends away they had been spending together have really sealed the deal,” a second source revealed earlier this month. “Friends say they can see them staying together forever this time around. <a href=#>They are soulmates and always have been</a>.”</p><p>Following the end of her engagement to Affleck, the Second Act star tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>.

Lo thinks Jennifer is a kind and wonderful person and an amazing mother,” the insider added.</p><p>Garner and the Oscar winner finalized their divorce in October 2018, shortly after the Alias alum <a href=#>sparked a romance</a> with businessman <a href=#><strong>John Miller</strong></a>.
