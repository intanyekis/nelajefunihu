They happened to be at the same club by pure coincidence.</p><p>“Lucas was there underage,” Fawcus told the publication. Still, they were staring at each other from afar and eventually added each other on Facebook.</p><p>Yes, their romance predates Instagram slide-ins — they’ve been together for a long time!</p><p>The couple did, however, start their conversations on Facebook. They have yet to agree on whether Fawcus added Cruikshank on Facebook first or simply messaged him.</p><p>They do agree on one thing: they met thanks to YouTuber Kingsley, who introduced them.</p><h2><span id=Firsts_for_Lucas_Cruikshank_and_Matthew_Fawcus>Firsts for Lucas Cruikshank and Matthew Fawcus</span></h2><p>Cruikshank and his boyfriend went out for the first time and got some Pinkberry and drove around listening to Demi Lovato and Paris Hilton.</p><p>Even so, neither of them knows if that is to be considered their first date.</p><p>“We never knew if it was a date,” admitted Lucas. “We both felt creepily shy about it.”</p><p>Their first kiss didn’t happen until their fourth date, according to their list of firsts. It’s difficult to know when the first date was without an established first date, but Fawcus had this to say:</p><p>By the fourth date, I was thinking, [expletive] this is [expletive]. This is ridiculous, but I’m going to kiss him. I then kissed him.</p><h2><span id=Lucas_Cruikshank8217s_Debut>Lucas Cruikshank’s Debut</span></h2><p>Cruikshank came out as gay shortly before making his relationship public.</p><p>According to the New York Daily News, the then-19-year-old came out through a YouTube video with the assistance of his friend Jennifer Veal.</p><p>The video was a Q&A session in which the duo answered Twitter questions. A fan asked about Cruikshank’s sexual orientation in one of his questions.</p><p>“I’m gay,” Cruikshank exclaimed, bursting out laughing. “It’s strange saying it on camera.”</p><p>He went on to say that it had been an open secret among his friends and family and that he had never felt the need to publicly declare his preference.</p><p>Soon after, he asked the Disney star, “How come you didn’t have to make a video saying you’re gay?”</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American YouTuber</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Austin Evans | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Austin Evans is a well-known tech reviewer on YouTube and a social media celebrity.
