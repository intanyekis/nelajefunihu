Its been so long since I have wrote anything on here because I feel like for a while I was trying to digest it all and save it for the music. But its finally set in that I am living my dreams and doing with all my closest friends from Toronto. I wake up and never know what to expect from any given day but good or bad I always learn something from it. I have decided that I am going to push “It’s Never Enough” and focus completely on delivering Take Care to you all. I feel like my mind is truly ready to make this next album NOW and I don’t want that feeling to escape me.</span></p><p><span><span>Ugh, how are goons supposed to learn how to romance now??&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6eytLXSrZinm5VisbOtyp5krJmpqHqpsdJmp66spJ67qHnMrpqhZZGjwaqvyKmYrZ2UYr%2Bjecyir62ZoJp6qbvLnWRucGhpf3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-braun-sister-brother-ethnicity-and-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Braun | Sister Brother Ethnicity And Parents</span></a>
