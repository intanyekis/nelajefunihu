It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $4 million, as of the data presented in mid-2017.</p><h3>Ken Berry Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy was raised in Moline by his parents Bernice and Darrell. From early childhood his idols were <a href=#>Gene Kelly</a> and <a href=#>Fred Astaire</a>, and he dreamed of becoming a singer and dancer. He joined tap dancing, and won a local competition. Subsequently, he was invited to join the ensemble of travelling performers of Horace Heidt.
