As she sang in her gold, sequined gown, Twitter users (many of which were unfamiliar with her) showered the first-time Grammy-nominated country star with plaudits.</p><p>Although Guyton will be serving as host, she’s been nominated for the ACM’s New Female Artist of the Year award and will be taking the stage for another performance. She’ll be among the 25 artists slated to perform on stage, including fellow Black country artist <a href=# id=auto-tag_kane-brown data-tag=kane-brown>Kane Brown</a> (who will join Chris Young for a number) and gospel icon <a href=# id=auto-tag_cece-winans data-tag=cece-winans>CeCe Winans</a> (who will take the stage alongside Carrie Underwood).
