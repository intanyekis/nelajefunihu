Now on its ninth season, the show follows K-1 visa couples as they navigate language barriers, cultural differences, and the pressure to tie the knot on a ridiculously expedited timeframe. With such high stakes, it’s no wonder that even the most well-adjusted <strong><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a></strong>couples end up calling it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the show has managed to spawn some rather resilient couples over its nine-season run, with a handful even going on to build rather impressive families. Regrettably, some of these <a href=#>longstanding couplings have proved so toxic</a> that their longevity has been rendered a point of concern rather than celebration. Here’s a run-down of some 90 Day Fiancé couples who shouldn't be together, but somehow still are.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has 90 Day Fiance Pulled Some Of Its Stars Out Of Poverty?</a></span></p><h2 id=angela-and-michael><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Angela And Michael</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angela-and-michael.jpg><p>When fans first met Angela and Michael on season two of 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days, it quickly became apparent that the two had a rather turbulent relationship dynamic. For one, Georgia native Angela constantly accused Michael, who hails from Nigeria, of using her to obtain U.S citizenship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two went on to gain notoriety for their incredibly explosive fights and shocking reconciliations. Though Angela has been called out on multiple occasions for her crass antics and rather volatile temper, the two are still together.</p><h2 id=eric-and-leida><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eric And Leida</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eric-and-leida.jpg><p>Eric and Leida are among the most controversial 90 Day Fiance couples of all time. The two have constantly found themselves facing backlash from the 90 Day Fiance fandom, with Leida even being labeled one of the show’s worst villains for her cruelty toward Eric’s daughter Tasha.</p><p>Tensions between the couple have been escalating for years, with Eric even having to physically restrain Leida after she threatened to commit suicide at one point. Despite these glaring red flags, the couple is still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kalani-and-asuelu><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kalani And Asuelu</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kalani-and-aseulu.jpg><p>Kalani and Aseulu were responsible for some of the most disturbing moments on 90 Day Fiance’s sixth season, with the most downright bizarre being when Asuelu started slapping himself and howling like a dog following a slight altercation with another couple.</p><p>While much of the initial criticism seemed to center on Asuelu, Kalani has been receiving heavy backlash in recent times, with fans accusing her of, among other things, constantly gaslighting her husband.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Does '90 Day Fiance' Pay Its Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=jenny-and-sumit><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jenny And Sumit</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenny and Sumit's rollercoaster relationship has fascinated fans since they appeared on 90 Day Fiancé’s debut season. Apart from struggling with cultural differences, the two have displayed some rather problematic tendencies, leaving viewers to wonder why they’ve fought so hard to remain together.</p><p>"Jenny is definitely messy, explosive, selfish a little, and borderline abusive with how quickly she escalates things,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor </a>recently said of the couple, “but Sumit is also an extreme compulsive liar and has codependency issues with his devil of a mother."</p><h2 id=corey-and-evelin><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Corey And Evelin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season one couple Corey and Evelin have sparked fan outrage on multiple occasions, with season after season revealing more disturbing details about their dysfunctional relationship.</p><p>The twosome’s time on the franchise has been marred by unending controversy, including multiple cheating scandals, and rumors that their entire relationship is fabricated. Despite facing one predicament after the other, and seriously considering divorce on multiple occasions, the two are still together.</p><h2 id=gino-and-jasmine><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Gino And Jasmine</span></h2><p>Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda’s tumultuous love story started playing out on season five of 90 day Fiance: Before the 90 Days. Gino, who was still reeling from a previous abusive relationship, often found it difficult to control her jealousy, and would get enraged by even the most trivial interactions between Gino and other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Gino seemingly thrives on violating Jasmine’s trust, going as far as sending nude photos of her to an ex-girlfriend at one point. Despite the endless drama, the two are still together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Celebrity Fans Have Said About '90 Day Fiancé'</a></span></p><h2 id=bilal-and-shaeeda><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bilal And Shaeeda</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bilal-and-shaeeda.jpg><p>90 Day Fiancé newcomers Bilal Hazziez and Shaeeda Sween were responsible for some of the most controversial moments in season nine. The two got off to a rocky start when Shaeeda arrived to the U.S. and Bilal welcomed her with a poorly orchestrated prank designed to make her believe that he was financially destitute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although finances continued to be a contentious issue in their marriage in the coming months, the two eventually tied the knot in Jackson County on December 7, and are still together.</p><h2 id=patrick-and-thais><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Patrick And Thais</span></h2><p>Patrick and Thais are yet another problematic season nine couple who shouldn’t have made it down the aisle.</p><p>Throughout their time on the show, the couple seemed to move from one explosive fight to the next, with Patrick seemingly intent on stifling Thais’ independence by keeping their finances on a tight leash, and Thais powerless to challenge him without her own income.
