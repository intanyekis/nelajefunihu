The news was confirmed by the home’s executive director, Jordan Strohl.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He first gained notoriety while touring with his father, Maurice Hines Sr., and younger brother, Gregory, in a dance show called Hines, Hines & Dad. Maurice later made his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234813075>Broadway debut </a>in The Girl In The Pink Tights (1954). In 1963, the three performed together on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1963. Maurice continued his theatrical run in productions such as Bring Back Birdie (1981) and Hot Feet (2006), which he choreographed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The New York native became a <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234653293>Tony nominee </a>in 1986 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for his role in&nbsp;Uptown…It’s Hot!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-515354098.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Hines brothers also performed as feuding siblings Clay and Sandman Williams in The Cotton Club (1984), but also had real-life tension in their relationship. In Maurice’s 2019 <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234803419>documentary</a>, Maurice Hines: Bring Them&nbsp;Back, he revealed that he and Gregory had a disagreement that caused such a strain that they didn’t speak to each other for a decade. However, they reconciled in the late ’90s to be with their mother during her final days and they remained close until Gregory’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_death data-tag=death>death</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_gregory-hines data-tag=gregory-hines>Gregory Hines</a> died at age 57 in August 2003 after battling liver cancer. In 2013, Maurice toured select U.S. cities in a <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234836943>tribute show</a> dedicated to his late brother titled&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Tappin’ Thru Life</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Both brothers were praised as tap dancing icons, despite their varying styles. “My brother and I tap completely differently although we were both taught by Henry LeTang,” Maurice&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>told The Times in 1994</a>. “We have very different stances. My style tries to be exactly like Fayard Nicholas, a full body style. [Gregory] dances from the waist down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-515354106.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Maurice is survived by his adopted daughter, Cheryl Davis, whom he raised with former longtime companion Silas Davis.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_debbie-allen data-tag=debbie-allen>Debbie Allen</a>, friends of the Hines, shared <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234722917>a tribute</a> to him&nbsp;upon news of his death. “Maurice Hines, I was your first leading lady in a show, ‘Guys and Dolls,’ and I will always treasure our journey together. My tears are for my inability to speak with you or to hold you. I will ALWAYS SPEAK YOUR NAME. See you on the other side,” she wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">VIBE sends our condolences to those affected by this loss.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kutr7InJxmoJmjsrR5w56YnWVhZ4B1hJJwa29xXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-gates-divorce-behind-the-scenes-of-a-public-split.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Gates Divorce: Behind The Scenes Of A Public Split</span></a>
