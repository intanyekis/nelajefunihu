Pitch Perfect 2 is really happening, and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Anna Kendrick</a> </strong>will once again star. The 28-year-old actress confirmed to <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> on Thursday, Feb. 6 that she'll be reprising her role as Beca in the upcoming sequel to the 2012 cult musical film Pitch Perfect.</p><p>"I'm very excited!" Kendrick told Us at the Daisy Marc Jacobs Tweet Shop event in New York City. "I mean I've signed on with no script, so you know, if it becomes about parasailing instead of singing, don't blame me!" Pitch Perfect followed a women's college a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, as they competed to win Nationals.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pitch Perfect sequel was first confirmed to be in the works back in April. "That's kind of a weight off everybody's shoulders that it's done and happening," Kendrick explained of the casting news. "So that's very exciting."</p><p>The project is now full-speed-ahead, and Kendrick is looking forward to finding out which songs will be featured in the sequel. "I think, like musically, the theme is going to be a different kind of theme musically," the "Cups" singer said. "I mean, I'm sort of speculating, like I don't really know. I've heard, like, whispers of rumors. But I think tomorrow we're going to get into the actual music."</p><p>Kendrick's costar<strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Rebel Wilson</a></strong> will also return as Fat Amy. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> confirmed Feb. 6 that the 28-year-old actress has officially singed on, and Wilson also <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a>: "@AnnaKendrick47 & Myself: 2 Girls, 1 CUPS in Pitch Perfect 2 x." Kendrick's love interest in the first film, <strong>Skylar Astin</strong>, also told Us on Wednesday, Feb. 5 that he'll be reprising his role as Jesse, and can't wait to start filming.</p><p>"I'm pumped, I love the cast. I'm very close with the entire cast, we're all excited to get back," the 26-year-old actor told Us at the Hollywood premiere of his new film, Cavemen. "I'm actually excited for the couple months before we shoot it, when things really start to come together with the story and I start to hear what I'll be singing, and to what extent I'll be in the film. I'm sure we'll have a fun cast hangout before we all head back down to Baton Rouge."</p><p>When does shooting in Baton Rouge, La. begin?</p><p>"The rumor is sometime in May," Astin revealed.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> confirmed on Jan. 27 that <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong></a> will be directing the sequel. She played Gail in the first film, a commentator for the International Championship of Collegiate a Cappella, and was also a producer.</p><p>"Elizabeth added so much to the first one. She really pioneered the first one to happen at all," Astin told Us. "She is the one that read the book it's based on, and got it made. She was on set every single day in <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>, and in costume when she was playing her character. She was kind of co-directing with Jason [Moore] the whole time, and fixing problems on the other side of set. I can't wait to step on her side again."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Today show</a> on Feb. 5, Banks, 39, said she is up for the challenge of both directing and starring in Pitch Perfect 2.</p><p>"I'm reprising my role as Gail in the film and also directing the movie, which is a lot of responsibility," she admitted. "I'm really excited to be taking it on. Obviously, we had no idea that the first film would catch on as much as it has . . . I hope to bring as much sort of joyfulness, fun and musicality in the second one, which will be out in 2015."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinppFiuKa6w6ugnKNdmLyvssirpKxloJ7BpLSMqZyrnpWYwW5%2BjKKtnmWjnrSvscNmpqdlp57BqXnNqGSsm6KevbV5kWlobW9iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1158370-aew-revolution-announced-takes-place-feb-29-2020.html><span>←</span><span>AEW Revolution Announced, Takes Place Feb. 29, 2020</span></a>
